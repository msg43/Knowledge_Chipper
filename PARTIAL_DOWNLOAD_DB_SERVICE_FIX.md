# Partial Download Tracking - Database Service Fix

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Downloads failing with "No database service available"  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

After implementing mandatory database writes for partial download tracking, downloads were failing with:

```
ERROR | CRITICAL: No database service available - cannot track downloads
```

**Root Cause:** The `YouTubeDownloadProcessor.process()` method requires `db_service` to be passed via kwargs, but several calling locations weren't passing it.

---

## Solution

Added `db_service` parameter to all locations that call `YouTubeDownloadProcessor.process()`:

### Files Fixed:

1. **`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/transcription_tab.py`** (line 220)
   - Added database service import and pass to downloader
   - Used by: Transcription tab downloads

2. **`src/knowledge_system/core/connected_processing_coordinator.py`** (line 381)
   - Added database service import and pass to youtube_processor
   - Used by: Connected processing pipeline

3. **`src/knowledge_system/processors/unified_batch_processor.py`** (line 431)
   - Added database service import and pass to processor
   - Used by: Unified batch processing

## Changes Made

### Pattern Applied:

```python
# Before:
result = downloader.process(url, output_dir=downloads_dir)

# After:
from ...database.service import DatabaseService
db_service = DatabaseService()

result = downloader.process(
    url, 
    output_dir=downloads_dir,
    db_service=db_service
)
```

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
ERROR | CRITICAL: No database service available - cannot track downloads
ERROR | Download failed for https://youtu.be/...
```

### After Fix:
Downloads should now:
- ✅ Track audio and metadata separately
- ✅ Write to database successfully
- ✅ Clean up orphaned files on failure
- ✅ Mark partial downloads for retry

---

## Impact

- **All download paths** now have database service available
- **Partial download tracking** works correctly
- **No orphaned files** will be created
- **Retry logic** functions as designed

---

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - All download locations now pass database service correctly
