# Partial Download Tracking - Hotfix

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Settings object access error on startup  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Issue Description

**Error Message:**
```
WARNING | knowledge_system.gui.main_window_pyqt6:_run_startup_cleanup:224 | 
Startup cleanup failed: 'Settings' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Root Cause:**
The `Settings` object is a Pydantic `BaseModel`, not a dictionary. It doesn't have a `.get()` method.

**Location:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/main_window_pyqt6.py`, line 176

---

## Fix Applied

**Before:**
```python
output_dir = Path(self.settings.get("output_directory", "output"))
```

**After:**
```python
output_dir = Path(getattr(self.settings, "output_directory", "output"))
```

## Verification

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Output directory resolved: output
✓ Cleanup service initialized
✓ Startup validation completed

Results:
  Failed videos: 0
  Incomplete videos: 22
  Videos needing retry: 0
  Orphaned files: 0

✅ Startup cleanup will work correctly on next GUI launch!
```

## Impact

- **Before Fix:** Startup cleanup would fail silently with a warning
- **After Fix:** Startup cleanup runs successfully and validates all downloads

---

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - Startup cleanup now works correctly on GUI launch
