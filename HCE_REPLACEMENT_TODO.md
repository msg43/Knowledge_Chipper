## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for **completely replacing** the existing summarization and MOC system with the Hybrid Claim Extractor (HCE) system. This is a full replacement approach - no legacy system preservation or feature flags needed.

## Key Differences from Integration Approach
- **No feature flags** - HCE becomes the only system
- **Direct replacement** of SummarizerProcessor and MOCProcessor
- **Simplified implementation** - no dual code paths
- **Same UI/UX** - users see the same tabs and functionality
- **Enhanced outputs** - structured claims instead of simple summaries
