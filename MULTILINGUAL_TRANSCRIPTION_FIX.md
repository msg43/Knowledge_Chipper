# Multilingual Transcription Fix

## Problem Identified

The transcription quality validator was incorrectly failing non-English transcriptions by checking for English words regardless of the selected language. This was causing:

1. French transcriptions to be marked as "failures" 
2. Unnecessary retries with larger models
3. Poor user experience for multilingual content

## Root Cause

In `whisper_cpp_transcribe.py`, the `_validate_transcription_quality()` method was:
- Always checking for common English words
- Flagging transcriptions with <10% English words as failures
- Not considering the selected/detected language

## Fix Applied

### 1. Language-Aware Validation

Updated `_validate_transcription_quality()` to:
- Accept a `language` parameter
- Only check for English words when language is "en", "english", or None (auto-detect)
- Skip English word validation for other languages (fr, es, de, etc.)

### 2. Pass Language Context

- Extract requested language from kwargs
- Use detected language from Whisper output when available
- Pass appropriate language to validation method

## Result

Now the system:
- ✅ Correctly validates French transcriptions without English word checks
- ✅ Supports true multilingual transcription
- ✅ Only applies language-specific validation when appropriate
- ✅ Prevents false "quality failures" for non-English content

## Additional Changes Made

1. **Default Language**: Changed from "auto" to "en" to prevent auto-detection issues
2. **Language Setting**: Always passes the selected language (no more None for "auto")

## Future Considerations

As you suggested, removing the "auto" option entirely might be beneficial because:
- Auto-detection can be unreliable (as seen with French being detected for English content)
- Users typically know what language they're transcribing
- Explicit language selection ensures correct validation

The system now properly supports multilingual transcription without incorrectly failing non-English content!
