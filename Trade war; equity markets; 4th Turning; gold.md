## Summary

The speaker discusses various topics related to economics, finance, and geopolitics. Here are the main points:

1. **US-China trade war**: The speaker believes that China has "escalation dominance" in the trade war due to the US's badly broken ribs (i.e., its struggling bond market). China can sit tight and wait for empty store shelves in America to become an acute economic and political issue.
2. **Gold and silver**: The speaker thinks that gold will continue to outperform silver, and the gold-to-silver ratio will remain elevated or rise further over time. This is because sovereigns and central banks own gold on their balance sheets, which they can use to recapitalize their debt positions without affecting the real economy.
3. **US dollar decline and bond sell-off**: The speaker views this as a capital outflow action that will drive the rebalancing needed in the US economy. However, it's a very toxic and powerful medicine with executional risk and potential catastrophic consequences.
4. **Bitcoin and stable coins**: Despite China seemingly selling cues, the speaker believes that the underlying theme of the US government needing balance sheet and stable coins is still in play. Bitcoin can help the US government find balance sheet, which is why they still like bitcoin over the intermediate to longer term.

Other points discussed include:

* The US's attempt to decouple from China and its low probability of success
* The difficulty for the US to exert sufficient leverage on allies to stop trading with China
* The potential for a sovereign debt recap and central bank recap, which would use gold to recapitalize debt positions
* The importance of anesthetizing the real value of the bond market before engaging in a trade war

Overall, the speaker provides insights into the complex relationships between economics, finance, and geopolitics, highlighting the challenges and risks facing the US economy and its position in the global arena.

Hello everybody, Luke Groman FFT. Hope you are well and having a great week. It is beautiful weather here in Cleveland finally. We were in the 80s today, which uh if you've ever spent any time in Cleveland, uh it it's a time of year that you treasure because you've been through a long a long winter. So uh hopefully you're having a great week. I'm going to jump right in in the interest of brevity. As always, thank you very much for submitting questions. Really appreciate it. Love the discussion. First question is from JH. Do you think a long period of nominal US equity weakness is possible slash likely such as 1929 to 1955 1966 to82 20 to 2013 and then secondly is there any goldilock scenario that involves US dollar/ US treasury remaining the preeminent reserve asset US industrial onshoring US stocks up and inflation mild uh in dollar terms I do think it is possible uh to have uh like uh equity nominal equity softness for a long time. I think it's possible but I don't think it's very likely uh in gold terms and in Bitcoin terms. I think it's very likely that we are in the early days of an extended period of uh weakness in equities in gold and bitcoin terms. So if you think about it back 1929 1955 remember 1929 to 1933 the the weakness in equities was not against uh the dollar it was against the goldback dollar. In other words it was against gold. Uh and so yes we were off gold from 33 to 45 but then we were back on gold uh from 45 to 54. So a good chunk of that time you had equity weakness against gold. So I do think we'll see some period like that again. Same thing 66 through 71. So, uh, in terms of the, uh, um, uh, why you're unlikely to see it in dollar terms, uh, remember ultimately stocks de facto back the US Treasury market via the consumer spending link, which is tied in with uh, net capital gains, taxable IRA distributions, stock options. So nominally weak equities for too long a period of time creates nominally weak GDP. It creates nominally weak consumer spending. It creates in uh weak uh receipts increasing deficits increasing treasury borrowing which ultimately given where we are creates treasury dysfunction before too long. Uh and that's generally addressed with treasury or excuse me with with new dollar liquidity as we've seen repeatedly at various intervals over the last five six years. And once they inject all liquidity, it makes it tough to have nominal weakness in stocks persist for very long. So that's why I think nominal dollar equity weakness is unlikely. Uh but in gold and bitcoin terms pretty likely. Uh the release valve much more likely to be uh the dollar and in particular versus gold and bitcoin. In terms of the Goldilock scenario you laid out, uh I don't think the US can do that barring some sort of major technology shift um that pushes us way ahead of everybody else and sort of is the the way to create um a a a bargain that you can get people interested in in buying bonds. I would be happy to buy bonds at low interest rates if I had access to extremely cheap uh energy uh forever. That's a trade-off you could do. Um uh I could build a lowcost factory base versus China with that. But otherwise, I I think we're likely to see what to my eyes appears to be happening, which is an acceleration of a system that's moving away from treasuries as primary reserve asset uh towards gold and a more multilateral world. Next question is from Ed. What does it mean when you say endgame if the current administration does not follow the order of operations that you first prescribed? Uh as a reminder, the order of operations is you got to devalue debt the GDP one way or another. Significant negative real rates, revalue gold, buy down debt before you try to do anything drastic. Uh Doge or as it turns out, as we've seen in the last month, tariffs. Uh, the endgame is is ultimately, you know, I I sort of dislike that phrase. I know it's used a lot because the game never really ends. The rules just change. So, um, what that looks like is is rates up, stocks down until the Fed's forced into some version of yield curve control to contain yields. um or treasury does same to contain yields because debt to GDP is so high that the US government cannot afford uh yields above some certain level and if it's uh ultimately um you know that can spread to other sorts of debt we saw that in 2020 when the Fed swore they would never ever buy corporates and then they did uh and they obviously bought a lot of mortgage backs as well so that's what I mean about that dynamic of of what some people call endgame, but and when I short-handedly or or flippantly say it from SS. Would a 1944 style financial repression aka negative real interest rates uh be successful in 2025? Wouldn't social media make it hard, very hard or any for any private or institutional capital to hold bonds at negative real interest rates? Wouldn't this also lead to very negative election outcomes? Uh yes, great points. I don't think you could do the post 1944 uh financial repression scenario of significantly negative real interest rates without capital controls in the United States and really around the world and and certainly not for longer than a brief period if you were going to try to do it without capital controls. And so ultimately that's why you know in the prior comment where I said well if the Fed or Treasury are forced into effective yield curve control first they buy treasuries then they'd have to buy mortgage backs and then if they continued on they'd have to buy corporates and so on so forth because ultimately you have to end up buying the you know the whole the whole bond market basically because markets are efficient and if you don't have capital controls and those can be draconian. They can be regulatory. There's lots of different ways you can achieve that. But ultimately, to your point, uh, in free markets, uh, there are no suckers at the card table that are going to sit around and take significantly negative real interest rates, uh, which is coupon on the bonds well below the rate of inflation. They're just simply profit motivated entities cannot do so. And the amounts of debt we need to have negative real rates on are so big that it would bankrupt pretty much any uh profit motivated uh entity uh on a real basis and ultimately nominally uh were it to be pursued for any significant period of time. Uh from RR huge fan Luke thank you very much. How much of a fourth turning do you believe this really is and what does the new monetary system we're transitioning into look like? feels like wealth preservation at this moment has never been more important. How do us folks with families that have busted our butts at work for 30 to 40 years protect whatever wealth we've accumulated and not become collateral damage? Uh it's a great question. Uh I think the new ultimately uh I absolutely believe in uh forth turning long cycle kandrav cycle whatever you want to call it. uh because ultimately they're just descriptors of human nature. What's happening has happened over and over and over in human history throughout millennia. Uh and and it's it's it's nobody's fault and it's everybody's fault because it's human nature. we're we're we we do the same things over and over and the cycle is really just a reflection of everybody that remembers uh the mistakes from last time die and we're left with younger people who think they know better and then they learn the lesson and we all learn it and and uh the cycle repeats itself. So what what does the system look like? Ultimately, we are the the the fourth turning, the long cycle. It is all about unsustainable debt and a political fight. Um hopefully just metaphorical and regulatory, not literal, trying to figure out who is going to eat the losses on the unsustainable debt. Will the debt be written down? Will the debt be inflated away? Will the debt be paid in real terms? and uh the the the the standard of living of the debtors crushed. This is ultimately what these fourth turnings are about. Whose head is the debt going to fall on? And so luckily uh we can pretty safely assume they're not going to try to deflate uh to maintain the real value of the debt simply because the debt cannot be paid in that case. So they need to inflate it away. Um there's different methods they can do that and luckily we can protect ourselves uh uh by putting uh putting some wealth into into physical gold, putting some wealth into Bitcoin. Um I think for this part of the cycle, I don't think it's crazy to have 20% of your wealth in some combination of gold and Bitcoin. Um for somebody closer to retirement, you said you've been working 30, 40 years. Uh, look, Bitcoin is very volatile and can fall a lot in, you know, for for multi-year periods of time. So, I think having some Bitcoin around is is good. I think it needs to be a small part if you're close to retirement more in gold. If you're younger, uh, you can weather out you can uh that that volatility, that inhumane volatility at times in Bitcoin uh because you've got a lot longer to weather that volatility. So, that's how I uh that's how I would think about that. Uh in next question is from BB. Is it too late to take a position in gold? Time horizon is next two to three years. Uh the short version is no, it's not too late. Um I think it's it's if your time horizon is 2 to 3 years. Um there are things that could change that view. Uh but they would be very drastic in terms of uh political changes, economic changes, etc. To my to my eyes, it's uh pretty high conviction when you look out two to three years that the system is transitioning in a way towards a neutral reserve asset. And it seems pretty clear to me that gold is going to have some role in that. So I don't think it's too early if your time horizon is 2 to 3 years out. Next question from TMT. Number one, is a decoupling from China being attempted? In my opinion, yes. Number two, can the US exert sufficient leverage on allies to stop trading with China? Uh, in my opinion, no. Uh, number three, will the US be able to simultaneously push longdated bonds on allies as a price of admission to a new trade sphere? Um, low probability. Excuse me. No, I don't I don't think so. Not without either revaluing gold significantly higher one way or another in my opinion or the US having some trump card up their sleeve, pun intended, uh where we have some sort of mind-boggling technology that allows us to say, "Look, if you're with us, you get access to it and if you're not, you don't." And even that's tricky because once it's out there, the Chinese are going to have it pretty quickly I suspect. So that's just the way things go as we've seen. So um I don't think the US will be able to push longdated bonds on allies as a price of admission without that that technology trump card or without revaluing gold significantly higher. And then the fourth question, probability of success as you see it and what can China do to thwart such a plan? Uh to the extent that Besson's plan is to uh encircle China and cut them out, uh I assign a very low probability of success. Um, and what can China and and and the reason I say there's a low probability of success is that look until the US devalues its debt to GDP you China China shut down its economy for a year 18 months under co they can take pain for 12 to 18 months the United States bond market dysfunctioned after 4 and 1/2 days and people that were saying we can take the were on X saying, "Help us, you know, help us, Jay. Powell, help us. Help us, Bess. Maybe let's not go so fast." So, the bond market I I've equated in in writings for clients, the bond market in the US is like badly broken ribs on a on an MMA fighter that the other professional fighter knows about. And so, what's going to happen in that fight? any any time they can, the professional fighters is going to beat on those badly broken ribs and drop the weakened fighter to his knees. So if the US wants to play hard ball, if they want to fight, if they want to trade war, you can't go into trade war with badly broken ribs. And the bond market is badly broken ribs. You need to anesthetize the real value of the bond market first or you will lose. And we started to see that. What does anesthetize the bond market look like? QE, yield curve control, revalue the gold and buy it down, whatever you want to do. Uh, do it. Um, get it over with. But for the US to win the trade war, the real value of US treasuries must, I repeat, must lose. Um, and in terms of what can China do to thwart such a plan, China can just sit tight. China can sit tight and let the badly broken ribs of the US which is the US Treasury market uh continue to have issues um and then in another two three four months once US store shelves start going empty you know China was locked down for 12 to 18 months Americans fight over toilet paper in Walmart um you know back in co so China can sit tight and I think they can sit tight and wait for empty storeshelves in America to become an acute economic and political issue. Uh, and so I don't I I think I I've said it since day one. I continue to think it. I think markets are mispricing leverage in in the trade war. The I think I've seen it phrased escalation dominance. I think China has escalation dominance in this. Um both because of the broken ribs of the bond market and because uh American store shelves are going to start going empty in in I don't know 2 months, 3 months, 5 months. I don't know what it is, but it ain't it ain't years. And China's locked its people down for years. And yes, they're facing deflation. Yes, they're seeing pain. Yes, their exporters are in trouble. And they have the goods. They they're not going to be short stuff. So, uh appreciate the question. Next one from JC Luke. Gold has played out as you predicted. Does silver follow as it normally does historically? Thanks, Jim. Uh, in my opinion, I think the gold to silver ratio, which I understand is historically high, uh, is going to remain elevated and probably rise further over time. I'm not saying there won't be periods where we see the gold to silver ratio fall. So 100 now, could it go back to 90, 85? Sure. But I think in two years time, three years time, four years time, it's going to be higher than 100 and maybe substantially higher than 100. Uh, and the reason I say that is because if I'm right, uh, this is a sovereign debt recap. That's all we're talking about here. And a central bank recap. And sovereigns and central banks, they don't own silver on their balance sheets. They own gold. And so if they're going to recap, they're going to use gold, which means basically they're going to recap their debt positions using gold, which is nice because as everyone knows, as the detractors always say, gold isn't used for anything. Well, if gold isn't used for anything, they can take gold to some really big number to recap the the unproductive and the the the sovereign debt on their balance sheet, and it doesn't affect the real economy because it's not used for anything. If silver were used in a recap, suddenly iPhones become unaffordable, solar panels become unaffordable. All those silver applications in industrial applications become very expensive and that drives inflation up which is counterproductive if you're trying to resolve a sovereign debt issue. if you're trying to resolve re debt recap. So I that's why I think ultimately the gold to silver ratio is is is likely to be higher in 2 three years uh than it is today. Now I I own a little silver. I think silver I I I like silver. I think silver will do fine but I think gold is going to continue to significantly outperform silver over the course of this force turning from SH dollars decline and bonds selling off. What do you make of it? uh it's capital outflow action um full stop especially with equities down so it's dangerous for a country uh with twin deficits and needing foreign capital like the US uh long-term it will drive the rebalancing needed uh if it continues and and there are signs as we've discussed that that the Trump administration wants it to continue in terms of some of the things they've highlighted uh CEA White House CE my um the America first investment policy memo laid out by Trump in February basically said China take your money go home. Uh the the issue is the executional risk and the path from here to there right it's it's ultimately uh would be very good for the US. I think it will drive the rebalancing that Bessant was talking about again this week. Uh but it's very very dangerous medicine. It's a very toxic and powerful medicine. um painful best case, catastrophic, fatal worst case. So, you know, let's watch. And the final question from JL in the December 17th, 2024 issue of Tree Rings, Micro Strategy in the Q's, Bitcoin becomes big enough to become a reserve asset. Is that now off the table with China seemingly selling cues? Uh very good question. And uh that did not play out the way I thought. I was wrong about that. uh simply uh by virtue of you I couldn't have known that the Trump administration was basically going to put out a memo in February telling telling China they don't want their money in the queues anymore. Uh that's a surprise I think to everybody. With that said, note that the Trump administration is still talking about using T bills in or putting T bills into stable coins using stable coins as a means to drive demand for T bills. uh and what they're and obviously they've talked about the Bitcoin uh strategic Bitcoin reserve left unsaid in all of that is that a the higher the Bitcoin price uh the more stable coin demand the more T-bill demand there is which is really uh that was the core of what we were saying and all that. So I I think the the the vessel or the mechanism of of Micro Strategy as Trojan horse to get China to help you bid up um Micro Strategy who then in turn issues shares and buys buys Bitcoin etc in a virtuous cycle. I think that is off the table for now at least. But I think the underlying theme of uh US government desperately needs balance sheet and stable coins and therefore bitcoin can help the US government find balance sheet. I think that is absolutely still in play and it's why we still one of the reasons we still like bitcoin um uh o over the uh intermediate longer term. So with that I'm going to finish up for the night. Thank you as always for joining me.
