## Full Transcript

**Speaker 2**
*00:00*

This phrase is sitting here in my notes because you've used it a bunch. Technofutilism. You've talked about the idea that Silicon Valley is basically trying to bring in as much foreign labor as possible to presumably keep its own costs down. That's obviously part of what you mean by technofutilism. But I don't think that's all of it, right? This is not just about H1B visas. So give me a broader view of what you think is wrong with the Silicon Valley view. Just a quick bunch of history. Obama is the most in the progressive

---

**Speaker 1**
*00:30*

administration of him and Biden, the most reactionary in American history. Number one, he made a Faustian bargain with the sociopathic overlords on in Wall Street to bail us out of the 2008 crisis, which still hasn't been resolved. At the same time, the Obama in the established order went to Silicon Valley and made a deal with them. And the deal was a following. We will allow you to become the most the wealthiest people in the history of the world. We will let you create an apartheid

**Speaker 1**
*01:00*

state. We will let you become monopolies before we get no anti-train. In fact, that's why you got Google and search. You got Facebook and what they do. You got Twitter and what they do. You've got Amazon destroying small businesses for the CCP. Every one of these guys are monopoly in the justice department for 10 or 12 years. It just looked the other way. So we'll let you become monopolies. We'll let you become the wealthiest people in earth. But here's the bargain. Here's what you have to do. You have to make the hegemon, the United States and the postwar international rules base order in the ruling class.

**Speaker 1**
*01:30*

You have to make us a dominant, dominant technological power of which we can, we have the commanding heist can never be questioned. And over the last 72 hours, what we've seen is two things. Number one in social media, the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA created TikTok, which is far more powerful than all the social media platforms of these guys put together, right? Forget that they use the information and the ownership. I'm just talking about the addictive nature and how evil can be put in there. And we now know that all

**Speaker 1**
*02:00*

the really, let's say hundreds of billions of dollars, not tens of bands, that we put into the theory of the case of blunt force computing power that, you know, the green new deals forgotten, climate change forgotten. You got to, you know, you got to build a power generators everywhere. You got to give over federal land for data centers everywhere. Five times the five, we got to burn more coal, more oil for these data centers because our method of AI, we understand that if this is not a siop, which I don't think it totally is, we've had our sputnik moment. And guess what?

**Speaker 1**
*02:30*

The oligarchs that we created who were all progressive Democrats, absolutely fucking face planted. Now here's the point. In techno feudalism, you're just a digital surf. You value as a human being as someone built and it made in the image and likeness of God in a doubt with the life spirit of the Holy Spirit is not, they don't consider that everything's digital them. They are at the end of the day transhumanist. And what is transhumanist? Transhumanist is somebody sees homo sapien here and homo sapien here.

**Speaker 1**
*03:00*

homo sapien plus, right, plus on the other side what they call the singularity. And that's why they're all rushing, whether it's artificial intelligence, regenerative robotics, quantum computing, advanced ship design, CRISPR, biotech, all of it to come to this point of which the oligarchs are going to lead that revolution. And why are they going to do it? Number one, we get to know them and see where they spend the money. It's because they want eternal life. You know why? Because they're complete atheistic 11 year old boys that are kind of science fiction, dungeon and dragons guys.

**Speaker 1**
*03:30*

And we've turned the nation over to that. And yes, I'm going to fight it every fucking step of the way. This is taking us back a millennium to feudalism. This is what they're, they're business models based upon that in the progressive left made a deal with these guys. They're all lefties. Elon got had the first awakening because he could kind of as an engineer, you kind of see the math. He fully supported our plan of a base plus election to go to the low information voters in the moms or America who had flipped during the pandemic. He backed that strategy in the

**Speaker 1**
*04:00*

way. He's the first. But the rest of them, even Andreessen, they're all super progressive liberals. They're all technofutilists. They don't give a flying fuck about the human being. And I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, Chinese. They don't care. And they have to be stopped. If we don't stop it and we don't stop it now, it's going to destroy not just this country is going to destroy the world. And you see this artificial

---

**Speaker 2**
*04:30*

intelligence. We have no controls over this. We've allowed these monopolies to exist. And now we know they're getting their ass handed to them. I think by the Chinese Communist Party, we're in deep shit right now. We're in a crisis. All right. I want to, I want to go to the transhumanist stuff first. And then to the policy stuff and Trump and whether any of this can be stopped. So to me, I think that there are, there are different groups in Silicon Valley. I think that you're right that generally

**Speaker 2**
*05:00*

people, including readers of this newspaper listeners of this podcast underestimate just how weird the long-term ambitions of a lot of people deeply involved in Silicon Valley are, especially around artificial intelligence. And that there is this sort of. And no, wait, wait, no, no, no, no. The lodge in the network state. Yes, talk about that. They're not weird. Well, they're radicals. They're radicals. That's a rat. Yeah. The network state we can save for the next time I have you on for now. Let's just focus on

**Speaker 2**
*05:30*

the questions. I'm sure you're going to get it. Get me invited. We've got more of this every news. Bannon's actually going to be invited back. We're going to every every week, man. So listen. So so the transhumanism stuff, though. So with it's to me, it seemed like one of the things that pulled Elon Musk into the conservative coalition was that while he's not certainly not a religious conservative not, but he is a kind of weirdo humanist, right?

---

**Speaker 1**
*06:00*

He likes the human race. He wants the human race to continue. No, no. Okay. So you don't see to me, to me, it seems like he's in one group. Musk, look, Musk is just as transhumanist as the rest of them. No, since Edison, maybe our greatest applied engineer. Okay. He is a genius. Agreed. Agreed. And so he looks at this thing as all kind of mathematical equations of from engineering in a big brain when he puts on something to solve it. He is the, the most

**Speaker 1**
*06:30*

fundamental that crowd has warned against artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence. One of the reasons he and the Altman at at at open AI have had so many big fights. It'd be not big fans of each other. Yep. Not the hate each other. I mean, and and and part of that's personal, but part of it is philosophical. And brother Musk is far probably the farthest down the line because he's the most advanced in chip and shipping. So I think Nora Link is one of the most most aggressive about

**Speaker 1**
*07:00*

it. And homo sapien 1.0, homo sapien 2.0. Elon is at the tip of this. And Elon is actually on a applied engineering basis, not bullshit talk. He is probably the farthest advance for transhumanism. People can have to understand in the life. And I say life next 10 years of your audience, we're going to be facing a dilemma for yourself and your kids. Do you enhance yourself? Do you enhance yourself, either by genetic engineering? Do you

**Speaker 1**
*07:30*

want it by the inch chip design plugged into you? Do you enhance yourself by artificial intelligence? Elon's one of the top accelerationists about driving this thing faster, faster at accelerating and increasing rate. You're going to have to make a choice in your own life, not just politically and society, your own life. Do I do this? Am I a Luddite? Will I get left behind more importantly? Will my children get left behind? Do my children have a shot to really play sports in the division one level? Are my kids have a ability to go to an

---

**Speaker 2**
*08:00*

I really school unless I get them enhanced? These questions, deep questions, never before handle in mankind's history are going to happen and going to happen in the next couple of years. But so let's let's then take it back to politics, right? I don't see this critique that you're offering. It kind of we'll call it a kind of religious humanist critique of Silicon Valley where AI is going maybe where, you know, digital augmentation is going

**Speaker 2**
*08:30*

to happen. I don't see this as expressed in any kind of powerful way in the Trump White House. Two weeks in, you know, making big announcements with, you know, with Sam Altman, right? Big announcements about investing in AI. One of the main reasons clearly from my conversation with Mark Andreessen that part of Silicon Valley's one toward Trump was a fear of regulation on AI from the Biden administration. I completely agree with you that the Obama

**Speaker 2**
*09:00*

disagreed on the deal, right? They went, they did antitrust stuff. They tried, you know, they tried to regulate the whole of government and leading the whole of society had a thing that they wanted a few large entities of which they then could kind of try to control, right? And and stop the entrepreneurs. And that's right. I think Andreessen in the venture capital

**Speaker 2**
*09:30*

community. Yeah. Andreessen, he was, yeah, he obviously did not like that. But I mean, even from, but from your perspective, right? If AI is a threat to our humanity and it's going to happen in some form, it's going to happen in China in some form, right? Wouldn't it be better to have the Biden approach of a kind of state capture of AI than to have, you know, endless proliferating technology? Or is it better to have like which form of AI do you as an AI skeptic prefer?

---

**Speaker 1**
*10:00*

The Andreessen version or the Biden, you know, three big company version.

**Speaker 1**
*10:30*

And what he's doing there is magnificent. Now when you talk about the deeper issues we face, you know, it's, it's a process. I've started off. When I first started this, you know, people that I really admire were just like populism. What are you talking about? It's like, and don't say nationalism because that's, you know, nationalism doesn't go to good places. I said, no, we're populist, nationalist. So I had long odds before. This one's long odds. Now we've got the Sputnik mode.

**Speaker 1**
*11:00*

And now we're in a horrible national security dilemma. And yes, President Trump, as he always does, and this is the way President Trump rolls, President Trump listens to a lot of voices. And he will think it over and then he'll make a decision. And clearly, the tech, the brola garks have because of their ability to get in there. And also I consider the inauguration day, like they're on display, like on the deck of the battleship

---

**Speaker 2**
*11:30*

of Missouri. And he's MacArthur. And they're there. They're the imperial Japanese staff sounding the surrender document. But they're in there. They're inside. They're inside the wire. Well, and there's a difference. I mean, I think what you said about Zuckerberg though is right. There's a group of people in tech who decided to support Trump the night that he won the 2024 election. That's absolutely true. And a lot of the guys who are there for the inauguration were, you know, I think general defeated generals paraded in a Roman triumph, right?

---

**Speaker 1**
*12:00*

Just musk is not like that, right? Musk is not like that. A bunch of the people around musk are not like that. Yes. Yes. And I don't think Andrewsons like that either. Right. No, these are people who were who were already deeply alienated from hangout hangout. And recent in musk are smart enough to be able to get below the surface on the numbers and see the direction of the country and climb on board as the techno futilist early on. They are hardcore techno futilist. They're not populists. You know, I tease Elon all the time. If I could turn him from a techno

**Speaker 1**
*12:30*

futilist globalist to a populist nationalist, we could make some progress here. He's a definitely a techno futilist, one of the hardest core. And so is Andrewsson. And these guys are smite me. Andrewsson, these guys, you know, I'm a genius level intelligence. These are not dumb people. But they're not with us when it comes to the little guy. Listen. Right. Well, they're bottom line. But their view is let's let's let's get let's give it. Let's do right there. Their view is connected to the argument you just made, right? Which is that there's a technological frontier. We are competing

---

**Speaker 2**
*13:00*

with China on a technological frontier. Andrewsson basically made a kind of he's out. He did not make a populist argument, but he made a nationalist argument. He said, look, that we want and what the Trump administration has promised us is for America to win for our companies to win for us to outcompete the Chinese and have what it takes to keep America, you know, sort of ahead of the curve, which we are at the moment, where even yes, I agree that, you know, deep seek the sort of the Chinese

---

**Speaker 1**
*13:30*

AI raises a lot of questions. I don't believe one fucking sentence of that. They don't believe that. They believe in this country because right now it protects them and provides some some benefits to them. Remember, we bailed out these fucks on Silicon Valley bank, Biden bailed them out when they couldn't make payroll. They could make payroll. They put more of their own money in, but they wouldn't. They have little guy bail them out in the Silicon Valley bank. Now in the last couple of days, what are they talking about? Oh my gosh, we need a martial plan. We need a space plan.

**Speaker 1**
*14:00*

We need a mercury plan. We need hundreds of billions of dollars from taxpayers to have what they want essentially a bailout. If it's a sputnik moment, somebody's got to ask a question. Yo, Andreessen, we made a deal with you guys. Elon, we made a deal with you guys. We made you oligarchs. We made you the richest people in the fucking history of the earth. We stopped any antitrust. It pisses me off the most. No antitrust. Not breaking these companies up and allowing entrepreneurs to get in there. Right. And because Mark Andreessen doesn't believe in the entrepreneurial system

---

**Speaker 2**
*14:30*

in the country, no way. Just to defend prior guests on this program as a matter of policy, you know, I think there is a big difference between how the sort of the big social media companies regarded themselves and how venture capital world regarded itself. I'm not going to look into anybody's soul and think about whether they believe in America, but they do believe they believe in a different form of competition than does, then does Google and Facebook and so on.

---

**Speaker 1**
*15:00*

And I think that's why they've always been, that's why they were always more sympathetic to the right. I'm not saying even Andreessen's a bad guy at the heart of it, but they're not, I mean, they don't think of the, you know, they're American as an idea. America's not an idea. It's not. It's a country with a border and a group of citizens that's the greatest resource we've ever had. And the apartheid state of Silicon Valley thinks we don't need our greatest resource, which the American citizens, they'd rather import

---

**Speaker 2**
*15:30*

basically indentured servants to work at third less and have an apartheid state. And then as soon as they can replace them with digital serfs. All right. Let's bring it back to policy and to trump himself on policy. Again, I don't think any of this is happening. But what is, you know, what, what is the specific populist answer to the oligarchs that you're talking about? Is it, you know, we should, you know,

**Speaker 2**
*16:00*

Trump should keep Lena Kahn around and do antitrust stuff. Is it, you know, taxation on these companies? Is it just not spending money and not investing in AI? Is it regulations on AI? What, what, what you could wave a magic wand and have the Trump White House do what you want around this stuff? What would you do? Number one, I would be a huge supporter of Lena Kahn remaining. And I would love to see Lena Kahn give him more power. And I think we ought to go and break up Silicon Valley because obviously in their scale, they haven't performed very well.

---

**Speaker 1**
*16:30*

And if you believe the power of the nascent power of deep seek and other things that are being released right now. So I also believe you have to have kind of massive, you cannot, we can't be in a situation where the state underwrites and a gate gives the accumulation of power. If the revolutionary generation came back, they would spit on the floor. And look, it's complicated.

**Speaker 1**
*17:00*

And I would love to have, I first, I would like to have a quick, a quick investigation and exactly how the intelligence community missed this. There's so many questions. And I realized that people who are a humanist or people who are religious and put their religion at the center of their being are going to be really on their back foot now with all the forces of world power against you. And the, and the thing is going to be you can't be a Luddite to be a Luddite and to want this to slow down or like the people in the Fahrenheit,

**Speaker 1**
*17:30*

or whatever, the book or out in the woods, they're memorizing, memorizing the great books. Yeah. The humanist podcasts. The human, you know, I mean, in the humanist, you don't have that moment because right now we have to strike because you have to compete on a national security basis because this is like Sputnik. It's an arms race. We're in a nuclear arms race. And I would just tell people, and particularly your readers who do not agree with me politically on anything, if I can besiege you for one thing is you must start to understand the

**Speaker 1**
*18:00*

moment we're in.
