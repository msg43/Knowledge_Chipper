# Transcription Stuck at 80% - Fix Summary

## Problem
The transcription process appeared to get stuck at 80% progress when using whisper-cli. The symptoms were:
1. Progress bar showed 100% prematurely (before transcription actually started)
2. The whisper-cli subprocess was hanging with no output
3. No timeout mechanism to detect and handle stuck processes

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Progress Bar Issue**: The progress bar was showing 100% because it was calculating progress based on file preparation completion rather than actual transcription progress.

2. **Subprocess Hanging**: The whisper-cli process was likely hanging due to:
   - No stdin handling (could be waiting for input)
   - No timeout mechanism
   - No detection of stuck processes

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Subprocess Handling
- Added `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` to prevent the process from hanging on input prompts
- Added comprehensive timeout mechanisms:
  - Overall timeout of 1 hour for any transcription
  - Detection of no output for 5 minutes
- Added better error logging and debugging output

### 2. Improved Progress Monitoring
- Added logging of all whisper.cpp stdout/stderr output for debugging
- Enhanced the output reading threads to be more robust
- Added queue size monitoring to detect when process stops producing output

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added checks to ensure whisper binary exists and is executable
- Added partial output collection before terminating stuck processes
- Improved error messages with more context

### 4. Default Parameters
- Set default thread count (-t 8) if not specified
- Set default batch size (-bs 8) if not specified

## Code Changes

### whisper_cpp_transcribe.py
1. Added timeout and stuck detection in `_run_whisper_with_progress`
2. Added `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` to Popen call
3. Enhanced stream reading with better error handling
4. Added debug logging for all whisper.cpp output
5. Added executable checks before running
6. Fixed subprocess.CompletedProcess return type

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run a transcription and monitor the logs for the new debug output
2. Check if whisper-cli is producing any output (should see `[whisper.cpp stdout/stderr]` messages)
3. If it still hangs, the timeout will kick in after 5 minutes of no output
4. The error messages will now provide more context about what went wrong

## Next Steps

If the issue persists after these changes:
1. Check the whisper-cli command manually in terminal to see if it runs
2. Look for any error messages in the debug logs
3. Consider if there are any system-specific issues (permissions, resources, etc.)
4. May need to investigate if the specific audio file format is causing issues
