# Python 3.13+ Upgrade Guide

## Overview

Successfully upgraded the Knowledge Chipper system to Python 3.13+ with full compatibility and improved performance. This upgrade was made possible by the FFmpeg migration that removed the pydub dependency which was incompatible with Python 3.13+.

## Why Upgrade to Python 3.13+?

- **Performance**: Python 3.13+ offers significant performance improvements
- **Features**: Missing modern language features and improvements
- **Maintenance**: Need to upgrade eventually anyway

### Benefits of Python 3.13+
- **Performance**: 10-60% faster startup, better memory usage
- **Security**: Latest security patches and updates
- **Features**: Modern language features and improvements
- **Long-term support**: Supported until 2028
- **Future-proof**: Ready for upcoming Python versions
