# Native macOS GUI Framework Comparison

## Best Options for Native Apple App Appearance

### 1. **PyQt6/PySide6** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Native Look**: ✅ Uses native macOS widgets (Cocoa under the hood)
- **Dark Mode**: ✅ Automatic support for macOS dark mode
- **Performance**: Excellent
- **Pros**: 
  - True native appearance on macOS
  - Follows macOS Human Interface Guidelines
  - Native file dialogs, menus, and system integration
  - Professional, commercial-grade
- **Cons**: 
  - Larger download size
  - Licensing (PyQt6 is GPL, PySide6 is LGPL)

### 2. **Toga** 
- **Native Look**: ✅ Specifically designed for native look
- **Dark Mode**: ✅ Follows system settings
- **Performance**: Good
- **Pros**: 
  - Uses native widgets on each platform
  - Part of BeeWare project
  - Simple API
- **Cons**: 
  - Less mature than Qt
  - Smaller community
  - Limited widget set

### 3. **PyObjC with Cocoa**
- **Native Look**: ✅ Direct access to macOS APIs
- **Dark Mode**: ✅ Full control
- **Performance**: Excellent
- **Pros**: 
  - 100% native - you're using actual Apple frameworks
  - Access to all macOS features
  - Can use Interface Builder
- **Cons**: 
  - macOS only (no cross-platform)
  - Steeper learning curve
  - Need to know Objective-C patterns

### 4. **Tkinter** (Not Recommended)
- **Native Look**: ⚠️ Attempts native look but fails on modern macOS
- **Dark Mode**: ❌ No automatic support
- **Performance**: Poor on macOS
- **Issues**: As we discovered, rendering problems on macOS

### 5. **Kivy/Flet/CustomTkinter** (Not Native)
- These create custom-styled interfaces that don't look native

## Quick Comparison Table

| Framework | Native Look | Dark Mode | Cross-Platform | Learning Curve |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| PyQt6     | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Auto | ✅ Yes | Medium |
| Toga      | ✅ Good | ✅ Auto | ✅ Yes | Easy |
| PyObjC    | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Full | ❌ No | Hard |
| Tkinter   | ⚠️ Poor | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Easy |

## Recommendation: PyQt6

For your Knowledge System, **PyQt6** is the best choice because:
1. It will look exactly like a native macOS app
2. Automatic dark mode support
3. Native file dialogs and system integration
4. Professional appearance users expect
5. Still works on Windows/Linux if needed

The example I created earlier (`example_pyqt6_gui.py`) already demonstrates this!
