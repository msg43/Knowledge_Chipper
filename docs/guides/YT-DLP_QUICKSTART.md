# yt-dlp Management - Quick Start Guide

## Your Questions, Answered Simply

### 1. How do we know when a new yt-dlp version has been released?

**Best Option: GitHub Watch (2 minutes setup)**
1. Go to https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
2. Click "Watch" button â†’ "Custom" â†’ Check "Releases" â†’ Apply
3. Done! GitHub will notify you of new releases.

**Alternative: Weekly Check**
```bash
make check-ytdlp-releases
```

### 2. How do we know what's in that version and whether it's risky?

**Automated Risk Assessment:**
```bash
make check-ytdlp-releases
```

This shows:
- ðŸ”´ CRITICAL â†’ Security issues (update NOW)
- ðŸŸ  HIGH â†’ Breaking changes (careful testing)
- ðŸŸ¢ SAFE â†’ YouTube fixes (safe to update!)
- ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM â†’ Normal changes (standard testing)
- ðŸŸ¢ LOW â†’ Minor fixes (safe to update)
