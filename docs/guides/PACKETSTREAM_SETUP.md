# PacketStream Configuration Setup

## ‚úÖ **Configuration Complete**

PacketStream credentials have been configured for the Knowledge Chipper system.

### **Files Created:**

1. **`config/packetstream.yaml`** ‚úÖ Created and Gitignored
   - Contains actual PacketStream credentials
   - Located in project root: `/Users/matthewgreer/Projects/Knowledge_Chipper/config/packetstream.yaml`
   - Copied to app: `scripts/.app_build/Skip the Podcast Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/config/packetstream.yaml`

2. **`.gitignore`** ‚úÖ Updated
   - Added: `config/packetstream.yaml`
   - Verified: File is properly ignored by git

### **Credentials Configured:**

```yaml
packetstream:
  username: "msg43"
  auth_key: "TnVr...Ol7S"  # (full key in config file)
```

### **Verification:**

```bash
‚úÖ PacketStream YAML file exists
   Username: msg43
   Auth key: TnVr...Ol7S
```

### **Git Status:**

```bash
$ git status config/packetstream.yaml
On branch system-2
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

‚úÖ **File is properly gitignored** - credentials will NOT be committed to repository.

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **To Use PacketStream with Tests:**

The credentials are now available in the config file. The system should automatically use them when running YouTube tests.

### **To Run Tests with PacketStream:**

```bash
cd "/Users/matthewgreer/Projects/Knowledge_Chipper/scripts/.app_build/Skip the Podcast Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS"
./venv/bin/python /Users/matthewgreer/Projects/Knowledge_Chipper/tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py
```

### **Alternative: Set Environment Variables:**

If the YAML config isn't being loaded, you can set environment variables:

```bash
export PACKETSTREAM_USERNAME="msg43"
export PACKETSTREAM_AUTH_KEY="TnVrSqzHMKp9Ol7S"
```

## üìù **Important Notes**

1. **Security**: 
   - Credentials are stored in gitignored file
   - Will NOT be committed to version control
   - Safe to use for local testing

2. **File Locations**:
   - Source config: `config/packetstream.yaml`
   - App config: `scripts/.app_build/Skip the Podcast Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/config/packetstream.yaml`

3. **Example File**:
   - Template: `config/packetstream.example.yaml`
   - This file IS committed (no credentials)
   - Used as reference for configuration format

---

## üîß **Expected Impact on Tests**

With PacketStream credentials configured, the 6 failing YouTube tests should now:

1. ‚úÖ Successfully authenticate with PacketStream
2. ‚úÖ Download YouTube videos via residential proxies
3. ‚úÖ Transcribe the downloaded videos
4. ‚úÖ Pass the tests

**Previous Test Results:**
- ‚ùå 6 YouTube tests failed (missing credentials)
- ‚úÖ 64 other tests passed

**Expected New Results:**
- ‚úÖ 70 tests should pass (100% success rate)
