# GUI Prompts Tab Modernization

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Updated the Prompts tab GUI to accurately reflect the current Unified Pipeline architecture, removing obsolete pipeline stages and clearly distinguishing between active and deprecated prompts.

---

## Problem

The GUI's Prompts tab was showing **7 separate pipeline stages** from the old architecture:

1. ✅ Unified Miner
2. ✅ Flagship Evaluator
3. ⚠️ Skimmer (optional)
4. ❌ Concept Extractor (`concepts_detect`) - **OBSOLETE**
5. ❌ Glossary Builder (`glossary_detect`) - **OBSOLETE**
6. ❌ People Detector (`people_detect`) - **OBSOLETE**
7. ❌ People Disambiguator (`people_disambiguate`) - **OBSOLETE**

However, the actual `UnifiedHCEPipeline` only uses **2 main stages**:

1. **Unified Miner** - Extracts ALL entities (claims, jargon, people, mental models) in ONE pass
2. **Flagship Evaluator** - Evaluates ALL entities in parallel

The old separate detection stages are no longer used in the main pipeline.

---

## Solution

### Updated `PIPELINE_STAGES` Dictionary

**Before:**
```python
PIPELINE_STAGES = {
    "unified_miner": {...},
    "flagship_evaluator": {...},
    "skim": {...},
    "concepts": {...},           # OBSOLETE
    "glossary": {...},           # OBSOLETE
    "people_detect": {...},      # OBSOLETE
    "people_disambiguate": {...} # OBSOLETE
}
```

**After:**
```python
PIPELINE_STAGES = {
    "unified_miner": {
        "name": "Unified Miner ⭐ ACTIVE",
        "description": "Extracts ALL entities in one pass: claims, jargon, people, and mental models (v2 schema)",
        "status": "active",
    },
    "flagship_evaluator": {
        "name": "Flagship Evaluator ⭐ ACTIVE",
        "description": "Reviews and ranks ALL extracted entities in parallel",
        "status": "active",
    },
    "skim": {
        "name": "Skimmer (Optional)",
        "description": "NOT used in main pipeline but available for custom workflows",
        "status": "optional",
    },
}
# Legacy stages completely removed from GUI
```

### UI Improvements

1. **Clean, Focused Interface**
   - Only shows 3 active/optional stages (removed 4 deprecated stages)
   - "⭐ Active Pipeline Stages" - Green header for current stages
   - No clutter from obsolete configuration options

2. **Visual Distinction**
   - Active stages: Green border (2px solid)
   - Optional stages: Orange border (1px solid)

3. **Status Indicators**
   - Active stages marked with ⭐ emoji
   - Clear status in stage names

4. **Informative Descriptions**
   - Active stages explain what they do and note v2 schema
   - Info text explains the unified architecture
   - Clear indication of what's used in production

5. **Simplified Workflow**
   - Users only see stages they can actually configure
   - No confusion about deprecated options
   - Cleaner, more professional appearance

---

## Changes Made

### File: `src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/prompts_tab.py`

**Lines 32-92:** Updated `PIPELINE_STAGES` and added `LEGACY_STAGES`
- Reduced active stages from 7 to 3 (2 active + 1 optional)
- Added status field to each stage
- Added detailed descriptions mentioning v2 schema
- Created separate `LEGACY_STAGES` dictionary

**Lines 160-276:** Redesigned UI layout
- Added architecture note in header
- Created separate sections for active and legacy stages
- Added visual styling (colors, borders, backgrounds)
- Added informative text explaining deprecation

**Lines 530-532:** Removed `_view_legacy_prompt()` method
- Legacy stages completely removed from GUI
- Cleaner, simpler codebase
- No deprecated functionality exposed to users

---

## User Experience

### Before
- Confusing: 7 stages shown, but only 2 actually used
- No indication which stages are active vs deprecated
- Users might try to configure obsolete stages
- No explanation of architecture changes
- Cluttered interface with deprecated options

### After
- Clear: Only 3 stages shown (2 active + 1 optional)
- Clean, focused interface
- No deprecated stages to confuse users
- Informative descriptions explain the unified architecture
- Professional, streamlined appearance
- Only shows what's actually used in production

---

## Architecture Documentation

The GUI now accurately reflects the **Unified Pipeline Architecture (October 2025)**:

### Current Pipeline Flow

```
1. Unified Miner (v2 schema)
   ├─ Extracts claims with evidence spans
   ├─ Extracts jargon with domain classification
   ├─ Extracts people with entity resolution
   └─ Extracts mental models with aliases
   
2. Flagship Evaluator
   ├─ Evaluates claims (importance, novelty, confidence)
   ├─ Evaluates jargon (relevance, clarity)
   ├─ Evaluates people (confidence, disambiguation)
   └─ Evaluates concepts (relevance, clarity)
   
3. Short Summary (pre-mining overview)
4. Long Summary (post-evaluation analysis)
5. Structured Categories (WikiData topics)
```

### Legacy Stages (Removed from GUI)

These stages are **no longer used** and have been removed from the GUI:

- `concepts_detect.txt` → Now part of Unified Miner (files remain in codebase for backward compatibility)
- `glossary_detect.txt` → Now part of Unified Miner (as "jargon")
- `people_detect.txt` → Now part of Unified Miner
- `people_disambiguate.txt` → Now handled by evaluators

**Note:** The legacy prompt files still exist in the codebase for backward compatibility with old code, but are no longer exposed in the GUI.

   - [ ] Dialog appears when viewing legacy prompts
   - [ ] Editor becomes read-only for legacy prompts
   - [ ] Prompt assignment works for active stages

3. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Architecture explanation is clear
   - [ ] Only 3 stages visible (no deprecated clutter)
   - [ ] Visual hierarchy guides attention to active stages
   - [ ] Interface feels clean and professional

   - Proper entity fields
   - Segment linkage

2. **V2 Prompts** (all `unified_miner_*.txt` variants)

Deprecated stages have been completely removed, eliminating confusion and presenting a professional, streamlined user experience.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for production use
