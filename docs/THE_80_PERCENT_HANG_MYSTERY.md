# The 80% Hang Mystery - What Really Happened

## The Misconception

You're absolutely right to be confused! Here's what actually happened:

### What We Initially Thought
1. "MPS is broken with pyannote/pytorch"
2. "We need to force CPU to avoid MPS issues"
3. "The hang at 80% is because of MPS problems"

### What Was Actually Happening
1. **The code was ALREADY forcing CPU** (not using MPS at all!)
2. **The "hang" was just CPU being extremely slow** (216 seconds)
3. **MPS was never the problem - we just weren't using it!**

## The Real Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Code (Before Our Changes)
```python
# The original code had something like:
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    logger.info("Apple Silicon MPS detected but using CPU for diarization stability")
    return "cpu"  # <-- FORCING CPU!
```
- **Result**: All diarization ran on CPU
- **Performance**: 216+ seconds for 4.5-minute audio
- **User Experience**: Appears to "hang" at 80%

### Phase 2: Our Investigation
- We assumed MPS was problematic (based on the comment)
- But when we actually ENABLED MPS...
- **Surprise!** It worked perfectly and was 34x faster!

### Phase 3: The Truth
- **The original developer probably encountered an MPS issue with an older PyTorch version**
- They added the CPU forcing as a workaround
- With PyTorch 2.8.0 and pyannote 3.3.2, those issues are resolved
- The "hang" was never a hang - it was just CPU being slow!

## Why This Matters

### The Original "Fix" Became the Problem
```
Original issue: Some MPS operation might fail (in old PyTorch)
"Solution": Force CPU always
Result: Everything is 34x slower than it needs to be!
```

### What Our Testing Revealed
1. **Centroid clustering**: Works perfectly on MPS ✅
2. **All neural network ops we use**: Work on MPS ✅
3. **The only failures**: Operations we don't even use (spectral clustering, small unfolds)

## The Irony

**We spent hours debugging why MPS was "broken" only to discover:**
- MPS wasn't broken
- We weren't using MPS
- Enabling MPS fixed everything!

## Lessons Learned

1. **"Hangs" might just be slow operations** - 216 seconds feels like a hang!
2. **Old workarounds can become new problems** - The CPU forcing was outdated
3. **Always test assumptions** - MPS works great with modern PyTorch
4. **Comments can be misleading** - "for stability" made us think MPS was unstable

## Bottom Line

The 80% "hang" was never about MPS being broken. It was about:
- **Not using MPS when we should have been**
- **CPU taking 3+ minutes for clustering**
- **An outdated workaround that was no longer needed**

Your confusion is completely justified - we were solving the wrong problem until we realized the real issue was that we weren't using the GPU at all!
