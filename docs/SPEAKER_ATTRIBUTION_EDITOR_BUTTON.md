**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Complete  
**Location:** Settings Tab â†’ "ðŸŽ¤ Edit Speaker Mappings" Button

## Overview

Added a convenient button to the Settings tab that allows users to directly open and edit the `speaker_attribution.yaml` file, which contains channel-to-speaker mappings for improved speaker recognition in transcriptions.

## Implementation Details

### Location

The button is placed in the Settings tab (API Keys tab) after the "Show Introduction Tab At Launch" checkbox, grouped with other settings controls.

### Features

1. **One-Click Access**
   - Opens `config/speaker_attribution.yaml` in the system's default text editor
   - No need to navigate file system manually

2. **Platform Support**
   - **macOS**: Uses `open` command
   - **Windows**: Uses `start` command
   - **Linux**: Uses `xdg-open` command

3. **User Guidance**
   - Tooltip explains what the file does and how to use it
   - Informational dialog shows after opening with:
     - File location
     - Edit instructions
     - Example format
     - Confirmation that changes take effect immediately

4. **Error Handling**
   - Validates file exists before attempting to open
   - Shows helpful error messages if file not found
   - Catches and reports any subprocess errors

### Button Styling

```python
QPushButton {
    background-color: #9C27B0;  # Purple color
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 14px;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Tooltip Content

```
Open the speaker attribution YAML file to edit channel-speaker mappings.
â€¢ Maps YouTube channels to their regular hosts/speakers
â€¢ Edit or add custom channel mappings for better speaker recognition
â€¢ Changes take effect immediately after saving the file
â€¢ Useful for adding your favorite podcasts not in the default list
```

## Use Cases

### Adding a Custom Podcast

Users can easily add their favorite podcast channels that aren't in the default 300+ channel list:

```yaml
channel_mappings:
  "My Favorite Podcast":
    hosts:
      - full_name: "John Smith"
        partial_names: ["John", "Smith"]
        role: "host"
```

### Correcting Speaker Names

If the system incorrectly identifies speakers, users can add or modify mappings:

```yaml
channel_mappings:
  "Tech Talk Daily":
    hosts:
      - full_name: "Jane Doe"
        partial_names: ["Jane", "Doe", "JD"]
        role: "host"
      - full_name: "Bob Johnson"
        partial_names: ["Bob", "Johnson"]
        role: "co-host"
```

## Benefits

1. **Accessibility**: No need to navigate to config folder manually
2. **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and examples provided
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Changes take effect as soon as file is saved
4. **Empowers Users**: Users can customize speaker recognition for their favorite content
5. **No Code Required**: Simple YAML editing, no Python knowledge needed

## Technical Details

### File Path Resolution

```python
config_dir = Path("config")
if not config_dir.exists():
    config_dir = Path("../config")

speaker_file = config_dir / "speaker_attribution.yaml"
```

### Opening Logic

```python
if sys.platform == "darwin":  # macOS
    subprocess.run(["open", str(speaker_file.absolute())], check=True)
elif sys.platform == "win32":  # Windows
    subprocess.run(["start", str(speaker_file.absolute())], shell=True, check=True)
else:  # Linux
    subprocess.run(["xdg-open", str(speaker_file.absolute())], check=True)
```

## Integration

### Files Modified

1. **src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/api_keys_tab.py**
   - Added button to UI (line ~472)
   - Added `_open_speaker_attribution_file()` method (line ~1062)

2. **MANIFEST.md**
   - Documented new feature in Recent Additions section

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

3. **Templates**: Provide templates for common podcast formats
4. **Auto-Discovery**: Suggest channels based on user's transcription history
