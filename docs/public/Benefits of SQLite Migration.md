Benefits of SQLite Migration:


## Benefits of Replacement Approach

### Simplification
- Single processing pipeline
- No feature flags or conditionals
- Cleaner codebase
- Easier maintenance

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Structured claim extraction vs. simple summaries
- Entity relationship tracking
- Contradiction detection
- Evidence-based outputs
- Cross-video analytics

### Better Performance
- Optimized for claim extraction
- Efficient SQLite queries
- No dual-system overhead
- Streamlined processing

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. User Adaptation
- Maintain familiar UI
- Provide clear documentation
- Offer training materials
- Gradual feature introduction

### 2. Data Compatibility
- Ensure file format compatibility
- Preserve existing workflows
- Migration tools for old data
- Backup and restore capability

### 3. Performance
- Benchmark against current system
- Optimize bottlenecks
- Cache strategic data
- Monitor resource usage

## Success Criteria
