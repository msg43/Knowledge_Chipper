# Update Crash Fixes

## Issue Summary
The updated update system was experiencing crashes where the progress dialog would hang and then the update would fail silently.

## Root Cause Analysis
The crash was likely caused by:
1. **Script Modification Errors**: String replacements not matching actual script content
2. **Threading Issues**: Qt signals not being handled properly during subprocess execution
3. **Lack of Error Handling**: No fallback when the advanced update process fails
4. **No Timeout Protection**: Update could hang indefinitely

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Debugging
- **Added comprehensive logging** throughout the update process
- **Added timeout protection** (10-minute maximum update time)
- **Enhanced error detection** with specific error pattern matching
- **Added subprocess validation** to ensure scripts are created correctly

### 2. Improved Script Modification Logic
- **Added fallback mechanism** - if sudo-free script creation fails, falls back to original script
- **Added script validation** - verifies created scripts exist and aren't empty
- **Enhanced debugging** - logs script sizes and creation process
- **Better error messages** - specific guidance based on error type

### 3. Worker Thread Protection
- **Added worker crash detection** - monitors when worker threads finish unexpectedly
- **Implemented fallback update method** - opens Terminal with original script if advanced update fails
- **Added graceful timeout handling** - terminates hung processes cleanly
- **Enhanced signal handling** - better connection between worker and UI

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **Progress feedback** - shows detailed progress messages during update
- **Fallback dialog** - offers Terminal-based update if advanced method fails
- **Clear error messages** - specific guidance for different error conditions
- **Automatic recovery** - tries multiple approaches before giving up

## Technical Changes

### UpdateWorker (`src/knowledge_system/gui/workers/update_worker.py`)
```python
# Enhanced error handling
try:
    sudo_free_script = self._create_sudo_free_script()
    logger.info(f"Created sudo-free script: {sudo_free_script}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to create sudo-free script: {e}")
    # Fallback to original script
    
# Timeout protection
if time.time() - start_time > max_update_time:
    logger.error("Update timeout reached")
    process.terminate()
    self.update_error.emit("Update timed out after 10 minutes")
    
# Better error detection
if "No such file or directory" in full_output:
    error = "Missing dependency. Please check your development environment."
```

### APIKeysTab (`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/api_keys_tab.py`)
```python
# Worker crash detection
self.update_worker.finished.connect(self._on_worker_finished)

# Fallback update method
def _fallback_update(self) -> None:
    """Fallback update method using Terminal."""
    # Opens Terminal with original build script
    
# Enhanced restart dialog
msg_box = QMessageBox(self)
restart_button = msg_box.addButton("Restart Now", QMessageBox.ButtonRole.AcceptRole)
```

## Debugging Features Added

### 1. Comprehensive Logging
- All update steps are logged with detailed information
- Script creation process is tracked
- Subprocess execution is monitored
- Error conditions are logged with full context

### 2. Validation Checks
- Verifies update script exists before starting
- Validates created temporary scripts aren't empty
- Checks bash syntax of generated scripts
- Monitors subprocess health during execution

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms
- If sudo-free script creation fails → uses original script
- If advanced update crashes → offers Terminal-based fallback
- If auto-restart fails → provides manual instructions
- Multiple recovery paths for different failure modes

## User Experience
The update system now provides:

1. **Real-time progress** with detailed status messages
2. **Automatic recovery** from common failure scenarios
3. **Fallback options** when advanced features fail
4. **Clear error messages** with actionable guidance
5. **Timeout protection** prevents indefinite hanging
6. **Crash detection** with automatic fallback offers

## Testing
- Added debug script to validate core functionality
- Verified script modifications work correctly
- Tested subprocess execution and error handling
- Confirmed fallback mechanisms work as expected

The update system should now be much more robust and provide a better experience even when issues occur.
