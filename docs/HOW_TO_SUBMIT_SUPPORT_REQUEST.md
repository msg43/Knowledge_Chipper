## Where to Submit

### Option 1: Through Apple Developer Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** https://developer.apple.com/contact/
2. **Select:** "Request Code-Level Support" or "Get Technical Support"
3. **Choose Topic:** 
   - Category: Developer Tools & Services
   - Subcategory: Code Signing & Notarization
4. **Copy/Paste:** The content from `APPLE_SUPPORT_REQUEST.md`

### Option 2: Through Developer App

1. Open the **Apple Developer** app on your Mac/iOS device
2. Navigate to **Support** section
3. Select **Technical Support**
4. Choose appropriate category
5. Paste the support request content

### Option 3: Via Email (If you have existing case)

If you already contacted support in September and have a case number:
- Reply to the original email thread
- Reference the case number
- Include the new information from `APPLE_SUPPORT_REQUEST.md`

## What to Include

The `APPLE_SUPPORT_REQUEST.md` file contains everything you need:
- ✅ All technical details
- ✅ Timeline of issue
- ✅ All submission IDs
- ✅ Troubleshooting steps completed
- ✅ Clear request for specific action

## After Submitting

1. **Save the case number** Apple provides
2. **Update this document** with the case number:
   ```
   Case Number: [ADD HERE]
   Submitted: December 29/30, 2025
   ```

3. **Check for responses** regularly - Apple typically responds within 1-2 business days for code-level support

4. **Be prepared to provide:**
   - Notarization logs (already have them)
   - Build scripts (already documented)
   - Screen sharing session (if requested)

## If You Have DTS (Developer Technical Support) Incidents

If your Apple Developer Program includes Technical Support Incidents (TSI), use one:

1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/support/technical/
2. Submit a new TSI
3. This typically gets faster, more detailed engineering support
4. Check your account to see if you have TSI credits available

## Follow-Up Timeline

- **Within 2 business days:** Expect initial response from Apple Support
- **If no response in 3 days:** Reply to ask for status update
- **If resolved:** Update all documentation files with solution
- **If escalated:** Apple may schedule a call or screen sharing session

## Forum Post Coordination

If you also post to Apple Developer Forums (recommended):
- Include the support case number in the forum post
- Include the forum thread URL in any support correspondence
- This helps Apple engineers see the full context
