# Notarization Status Report

## ✅ What's Working:
1. **Certificates Installed**: Both Developer ID certificates are installed
2. **Private Keys Present**: Private keys are properly linked
3. **Credentials Stored**: Apple ID credentials validated and stored in keychain
4. **Package Creation**: PKG files are being created and signed
5. **Notarization Submission**: Successfully submitting to Apple

## ❌ Current Issue:
Apple's notarization service is rejecting the certificates as invalid:
```
"The binary is not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate."
```

## Possible Causes:

### 1. Certificate Creation Date (Most Likely)
- Your certificates were created on **Sep 21, 2025** (4 days ago)
- New certificates sometimes take 24-48 hours to propagate through Apple's systems
- The notarization service might not recognize them yet

### 2. Certificate Type Issue
- The certificates might have been created incorrectly
- They might be missing required extensions or attributes

### 3. Certificate Trust Chain
- Despite local verification passing, Apple's servers might see a different trust chain

## Recommended Actions:

### Option 1: Wait and Retry (If certificates are new)
If you just created these certificates recently:
- Wait 24-48 hours for Apple's systems to fully recognize them
- Try notarization again tomorrow

### Option 2: Verify Certificate Creation
1. Log into https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list
2. Verify both certificates show as:
   - Type: "Developer ID Application" and "Developer ID Installer"
   - Status: Active/Valid
   - Platform: macOS

### Option 3: Test with Apple's codesign Tool
Try signing with verbose output to see more details:
```bash
codesign -vvv --deep --strict /tmp/notarization_test_*/TestApp.app
```

### Option 4: Create New Certificates
If the certificates are problematic:
1. Revoke existing certificates on developer.apple.com
2. Create new ones following Apple's exact process
3. Export as .p12 with private keys
4. Re-import to this Mac

## What We Know:
- Local signing appears to work (PKG is created)
- Notarization credentials are correct (authentication succeeds)
- The issue is specifically that Apple doesn't recognize the certificates as valid

## Next Steps:
1. **Check certificate age** - When exactly were they created?
2. **Verify on developer.apple.com** - Are they showing as valid there?
3. **Try tomorrow** - If they're new, waiting might resolve it
4. **Contact Apple Developer Support** - If the issue persists

The setup is 99% complete - we just need Apple to recognize your certificates as valid for notarization.
