# YouTube Download Processor Fixes

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Fixed

## Issues Identified

### 1. Critical Bug: Invalid yt-dlp Post-Processor Key
**Error**: `Error downloading audio: 'FFmpegAudioConvertorPP'`

**Root Cause**: 
- Line 84 used incorrect post-processor key: `"FFmpegAudioConvertor"`
- The correct yt-dlp post-processor key is: `"FFmpegExtractAudio"`
- When yt-dlp couldn't find this processor (internally adds "PP" suffix), it raised a KeyError

**Fix**: Changed post-processor configuration from:
```python
{"key": "FFmpegAudioConvertor", "preferredcodec": "mp3"}
```
to:
```python
{"key": "FFmpegExtractAudio", "preferredcodec": "mp3"}
```

### 2. PacketStream Proxy SSL Certificate Error
**Error**: `SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate'))`

**Root Cause**:
- Code at lines 300-320 was trying to use BrightData SSL certificate for PacketStream proxies
- PacketStream proxies don't require special SSL certificates
- This caused SSL verification failures during proxy connectivity tests

**Fix**: 
- Removed BrightData SSL certificate requirement
- Changed from HTTPS to HTTP for proxy test endpoint: `"http://httpbin.org/ip"`
- Added proper User-Agent header for better proxy compatibility

### 3. Pre-existing Linter Errors
**Error**: `"get" is not a known attribute of "None"` at lines 633, 637

**Root Cause**:
- `ydl_info.extract_info()` can return `None`
- Code didn't check for None before calling `.get()` method

**Fix**: Added None checks:
```python
duration_seconds = (
    info_only.get("duration", 3600) if info_only else 3600
)
video_title = (
    info_only.get("title", "Unknown Title")
    if info_only
    else "Unknown Title"
)
```

## Remaining YouTube Access Issues

While these bugs are fixed, YouTube is still blocking downloads with:
- "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" errors
- "Requested format is not available" errors

**These are YouTube's anti-bot protection measures, not application bugs.**

### Possible Solutions:
1. Configure browser cookies in PacketStream proxy settings
2. Use YouTube API instead of direct downloads (requires API key)
3. Ensure PacketStream proxy credentials are correctly configured
4. Try different proxy IP addresses through rotation

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/matthewgreer/Projects/Knowledge_Chipper/src/knowledge_system/processors/youtube_download.py`
   - Line 84: Fixed post-processor key
   - Lines 300-309: Fixed PacketStream proxy SSL test
   - Lines 633-641: Added None checks for `info_only`

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Ensure PacketStream credentials are configured in Settings > API Keys
2. Try downloading a single YouTube video
3. The application should no longer crash with KeyError
4. Proxy connectivity test should succeed without SSL errors

## Next Steps

If YouTube continues blocking downloads:
1. Check PacketStream proxy account status
2. Verify proxy credentials in Settings
3. Consider adding browser cookie authentication
4. Monitor proxy IP reputation
