### 2️⃣ "How do we know what is in that version and whether the changes are likely to break anything?"

**Short Answer:** Automated risk assessment built into the checker.

#### Risk Assessment System

Our `check_ytdlp_changelog.sh` script automatically analyzes release notes and assigns risk levels:

```
🔴 CRITICAL (Security)
   Keywords: security, vulnerability, CVE, exploit
   Action: Update immediately, emergency patch

🟠 HIGH (Breaking Changes)
   Keywords: breaking, incompatible, removed, deprecated
   Action: Test carefully, check if your code affected

🟢 SAFE (YouTube Fixes)
   Keywords: youtube, signature, extractor, format, throttling
   Action: Safe to update - this is why we update!

🟡 MEDIUM (Significant Changes)
   Keywords: changed, modified, refactor, rewrite
   Action: Test normally

🟢 LOW (Maintenance)
   Default: Bug fixes, minor improvements
   Action: Safe to update
```

#### Example Output
```bash
$ make check-ytdlp-releases

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Current version: 2025.9.26
🆕 Latest version:  2025.10.15

📌 2025.9.26 (YOUR VERSION) - 2025-09-26
   Risk: 🟢 SAFE
   Key changes:
     • Fix YouTube signature extraction
     • Improve format selection

🆕 2025.10.15 (LATEST) - 2025-10-15
   Risk: 🟢 SAFE
   Key changes:
     • Fix YouTube throttling
     • Add support for new video formats

🎯 RECOMMENDATION:
   🟢 SAFE: 1 YouTube fix(es) available
   ACTION: Safe to update - run: make test-ytdlp-update
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Complete Workflow

### Monday Morning Routine (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Check what's new
make check-ytdlp-releases

# 2. Read risk assessment
# If 🟢 SAFE or 🟢 LOW: proceed
# If 🟡 MEDIUM: normal testing
# If 🟠 HIGH: read full release notes first
# If 🔴 CRITICAL: update immediately

# 3. Test and update
make test-ytdlp-update

# 4. Commit if tests pass
git add requirements.txt pyproject.toml
git commit -m "Update yt-dlp to VERSION (tested)"
```

### Understanding Risk Levels

#### 🟢 SAFE - YouTube Fixes (Most Common)
**Example Release:**
```
- [YouTube] Fix signature extraction
- [YouTube] Work around throttling
- [YouTube] Improve format selection
```

**Why Safe:**
- These are the *exact* fixes we need
- Usually isolated to YouTube extractor
- Don't change core API or behavior
- This is why we keep yt-dlp updated!

**Action:** Update with confidence

---

#### 🟢 LOW - Maintenance Updates
**Example Release:**
```
- Fix progress bar display
- Update documentation
- Minor performance improvements
- Fix typo in error message
```

**Why Low Risk:**
- Small, isolated changes
- Cosmetic or documentation only
- Unlikely to break anything

**Action:** Safe to update

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM - Significant Changes
**Example Release:**
```
- Refactor download manager
- Changed default user agent
- Improved error handling
- Reorganized internal structure
```

**Why Medium:**
- Internal changes that might have edge cases
- Usually backward compatible
- Could affect behavior subtly

**Action:** Test with standard workflow

---

#### 🟠 HIGH - Breaking Changes
**Example Release:**
```
- Breaking: Changed hook signature
- Removed deprecated --old-flag
- Requires Python 3.11+
- Changed default behavior for X
```

**Why High Risk:**
- Could break your code if you use affected features
- May require code changes
- Could cause runtime errors

**Action:** 
1. Read full release notes carefully
2. Check if you use affected features
3. Test extensively
4. Consider waiting for next version if too risky

---

#### 🔴 CRITICAL - Security Issues
**Example Release:**
```
- Security: Fix cookie handling vulnerability (CVE-2024-1234)
- Security: Patch arbitrary code execution
```

**Why Critical:**
- Security vulnerabilities can expose user data
- Exploits might be actively used
- Legal/compliance implications

**Action:**
1. Update immediately
2. Test minimally (security > stability)
3. Release emergency patch
4. Better to ship working-but-minimally-tested than vulnerable
