- **Step 3:** Process first item with auto-process checkbox
- Clear, actionable instructions that match current UI

### 3. **User-Focused Tab Guide (7 Tabs)**
**Before:** Technical descriptions with backend implementation details
**After:** Practical guide focused on "what you'll do" in each tab:

2. **Transcribe** - "What you'll do: Add content... Key option: auto-process... Output: transcripts"
3. **Prompts** - "For expert users... Most users can skip this tab"
4. **Summarize** - "Turn transcripts into structured, scored claims"
5. **Review** - "See all extracted claims in a spreadsheet view... Search, filter, edit"
6. **Monitor** - "Set it and forget it... Perfect for RSS feeds"
7. **Settings** - "One-time setup... Required vs Optional"

Each tab includes:
- "What you'll do" action statement
