# Prompts Tab Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Prompts Tab has been completely redesigned to provide comprehensive prompt management and pipeline configuration capabilities. Users can now easily manage prompts, see their assignments, and control which prompts are used at each stage of the processing pipeline.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Pipeline Stage Assignments Display (Left Panel)

**What it does:**
- Shows all 7 HCE pipeline stages with descriptions
- Displays current prompt assignment for each stage
- Provides dropdown menus to change assignments
- Includes "View Assigned Prompt" buttons for quick access

**Pipeline stages configured:**
1. Unified Miner - Extracts claims, jargon, people, and mental models
2. Flagship Evaluator - Reviews and ranks extracted claims
3. Skimmer - High-level overview and milestone detection
4. Concept Extractor - Detects mental models and frameworks
5. Glossary Builder - Creates definitions for jargon
6. People Detector - Identifies people mentioned
7. People Disambiguator - Resolves ambiguous person references

**User benefits:**
- Clear visibility into pipeline configuration
- Easy reassignment of prompts to stages
- Understanding of what each stage does

### 2. Import Prompt Functionality

**What it does:**
- Adds "üì• Import Prompt" button
- Opens file dialog to select `.txt` files
- Allows choosing destination directory (HCE vs Config)
- Handles file name conflicts with overwrite confirmation
- Updates prompt list automatically

**User benefits:**
- Load custom prompts from external sources
- Experiment with community-shared prompts
- Version control of prompt variations
- No need to manually copy files

### 3. Delete Prompt Functionality

**What it does:**
- Adds "üóëÔ∏è Delete Prompt" button
- Checks if prompt is used by any pipeline stage
- Blocks deletion if prompt is in active use
- Requires explicit confirmation before deletion
- Updates all displays after deletion

**Safety features:**
- Cannot delete prompts assigned to pipeline stages
- Clear warning messages
- Confirmation dialog
- Immediate visual feedback

**User benefits:**
- Remove unused or experimental prompts

- Prevent accidental deletion of active prompts

### 4. Pipeline Stage Assignment Management

**What it does:**
- Dropdown menu for each pipeline stage
- Shows all available prompts as options
- Copies selected prompt content to stage location
- Displays confirmation message with stage details
- Updates usage indicators throughout UI

**User benefits:**
- Easily switch between prompt versions
- Configure pipeline stages without code changes
- Test different prompts on same pipeline stage
- Visual confirmation of assignments

### 5. Enhanced Usage Tracking

**What it does:**
- Shows which pipeline stages use each prompt
- Color-coded indicators (blue = in use, gray = unused)
- Real-time usage detection
- Updates automatically when assignments change

**Visual indicators:**
- ‚öôÔ∏è = HCE system prompt
- üìÑ = Config prompt
- Blue highlight = Currently assigned to pipeline stage(s)
- Gray background = Not assigned

**User benefits:**
- Understand prompt usage at a glance
- Prevent accidental modification of active prompts
- Identify unused prompts for deletion

### 6. Prompt Editor Improvements

**Enhancements:**
- Larger, more prominent editor
- Clear labeling of current prompt
- Usage information displayed
- Enable/disable controls based on state
- Revert changes functionality

**New buttons:**
- üíæ Save Changes - Enabled when modifications made
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Revert Changes - Discard unsaved edits
- Warning messages for pipeline prompt changes

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure

**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/prompts_tab.py`

**Key components:**
```python
PIPELINE_STAGES = {
    "stage_id": {
        "name": "Display Name",
        "description": "What this stage does",
        "prompt_path": "path/to/prompt.txt",
        "default_prompt": "default_file.txt"
    }
}
```

**New methods implemented:**
- `_create_pipeline_assignments_widget()` - Left panel UI
- `_create_prompt_editor_widget()` - Right panel UI
- `_refresh_pipeline_assignments()` - Update stage dropdowns
- `_on_stage_assignment_changed()` - Handle prompt reassignment
- `_view_stage_prompt()` - Load and display stage's prompt
- `_import_prompt()` - Import external prompt files
- `_delete_current_prompt()` - Remove prompts with safety checks
- `_revert_prompt_changes()` - Discard unsaved edits
- `_get_all_prompt_files()` - Scan both prompt directories

### Prompt Directories

**HCE Prompts:**
- Location: `src/knowledge_system/processors/hce/prompts/`
- Purpose: System prompts used by processing pipeline
- Usage: Automatically loaded by processor modules

**Config Prompts:**
- Location: `config/prompts/`
- Purpose: User-defined or experimental prompts
- Usage: Available for assignment but not auto-loaded

### Assignment Mechanism

When assigning a prompt to a stage:
1. User selects prompt from dropdown
2. System reads selected prompt's content
3. Content is written to stage's expected prompt path
4. Processor modules load it on next run
5. UI updates to reflect new assignment

### Usage Detection

The system detects usage by:
1. Reading each stage's prompt file content
2. Comparing against all available prompts
3. Matching content to identify assignments
4. Works even if files are in different locations

## User Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Customizing the Unified Miner

1. User clicks "View Assigned Prompt" for Unified Miner
2. Prompt appears in editor (right panel)
3. User modifies extraction criteria
4. Clicks "üíæ Save Changes"
5. Warning shows which stages are affected
6. Changes take effect on next processing run

### Example 2: Testing Alternative Prompts

1. User clicks "üì• Import Prompt"
2. Selects `unified_miner_detailed.txt` from downloads
3. Chooses "HCE Prompts" as destination
4. New prompt appears in list
5. In left panel, selects "unified_miner_detailed" from dropdown
6. Confirms assignment
7. Processes test content
8. Reviews results in Review tab
9. Keeps or reverts based on quality

### Example 3: Cleaning Up Unused Prompts

1. User sees several unused prompts (gray indicator)
2. Selects an unused prompt
3. Reviews content to confirm it's not needed
4. Clicks "üóëÔ∏è Delete Prompt"
5. Confirms deletion
6. Prompt removed from list
7. Library stays organized
