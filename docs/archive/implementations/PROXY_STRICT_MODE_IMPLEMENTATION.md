# Proxy Strict Mode Implementation

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive proxy strict mode functionality to protect user IP addresses from YouTube rate limits and bans when proxy connections fail.

## Problem

Previously, when the PacketStream proxy failed or wasn't configured, the system would silently fall back to direct connections, potentially exposing the user's personal IP address to YouTube's anti-bot detection and rate limiting systems.

## Solution

Added a new `proxy_strict_mode` configuration setting (default: **enabled**) that blocks all YouTube operations when proxy is unavailable, ensuring user IP safety.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration (`src/knowledge_system/config.py`)

Added `proxy_strict_mode` field to `YouTubeProcessingConfig`:
- **Default**: `True` (strict mode enabled for safety)
- **Description**: Blocks YouTube operations when proxy fails to protect IP address
- Located at line 396-399

### 2. Settings File (`config/settings.example.yaml`)

Added configuration section with clear documentation:
```yaml
youtube_processing:
  proxy_strict_mode: true  # RECOMMENDED - protects your IP
```

### 3. Proxy Service (`src/knowledge_system/utils/proxy/proxy_service.py`)

Added three new methods:
- `_is_strict_mode_enabled()`: Checks if strict mode is enabled in config
- `is_using_direct_connection()`: Checks if currently using direct connection
- `validate_for_youtube_operation()`: Validates proxy safety before YouTube operations

### 4. YouTube Download Processor (`src/knowledge_system/processors/youtube_download.py`)

Updated fallback logic in three locations:
- **Proxy not configured** (line 271-296): Blocks operation if strict mode enabled
- **Proxy initialization error** (line 307-332): Blocks operation if strict mode enabled
- **Proxy test failure** (line 447-473): Blocks operation if strict mode enabled

All fallbacks now:
1. Check strict mode setting
2. If enabled: Block operation with clear error message
3. If disabled: Allow fallback with warning

### 5. Transcription Tab (`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/transcription_tab.py`)

Added strict mode checking in UI with user-friendly dialogs:
- **Proxy test fails** (line 2294-2310): Shows critical dialog, blocks operation
- **No proxy credentials** (line 2312-2327): Shows critical dialog, blocks operation
- **Proxy error** (line 2334-2350): Shows critical dialog, blocks operation
- **Proxy disabled by user** (line 2355-2371): Shows critical dialog, blocks operation

Each dialog explains:
- What happened (proxy failure/missing)
- Why operation is blocked (IP protection)
- How to fix (configure proxy OR disable strict mode)
- That disabling strict mode is not recommended

### 6. YouTube Metadata Processor (`src/knowledge_system/processors/youtube_metadata_proxy.py`)

Updated metadata extraction to respect strict mode:
- Checks strict mode when no proxy available (line 183-196)
- Returns None (failure) instead of using direct connection

### 7. API Keys Tab (`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/api_keys_tab.py`)

Added UI toggle with comprehensive documentation:
- **Checkbox**: "🛡️ Proxy Strict Mode (RECOMMENDED)" (line 248-273)
- **Tooltip**: Explains enabled vs disabled risks
- **Styling**: Bold font to emphasize importance
- **Load logic**: Loads from config with True default (line 636-646)
- **Save logic**: Persists to both runtime config and YAML file (line 779-782, 843-848)

## User Experience

### With Strict Mode Enabled (Default)

**Scenario**: Proxy fails or isn't configured

**Result**:
1. Operation is blocked immediately
2. User sees clear error dialog explaining:
   - What happened
   - Why it's blocked (IP protection)
   - How to fix it
3. Log shows detailed information
4. No personal IP exposure risk

**Fix Options**:
- Configure/fix PacketStream credentials
- Disable strict mode (not recommended)

### With Strict Mode Disabled

**Scenario**: Proxy fails or isn't configured

**Result**:
1. System falls back to direct connection
2. User sees warnings about risk
3. Operation proceeds with user's personal IP
4. **RISK**: IP may be rate-limited or banned by YouTube

## Configuration Locations

### Runtime Configuration
- Setting: `settings.youtube_processing.proxy_strict_mode`
- Default: `True`
- Scope: In-memory configuration object

### Persistent Storage
- File: `config/settings.yaml` (user settings)
- File: `config/credentials.yaml` (saved with credentials)
- Section: `youtube_processing.proxy_strict_mode`

### UI Control
- Tab: Settings > API Keys
- Location: Below PacketStream credentials
- Control: Checkbox (bold, with shield icon)

## Testing

The implementation has been completed with:
- ✅ Configuration schema updated
- ✅ Proxy service validation added
- ✅ YouTube download processor updated
- ✅ Transcription tab UI updated with dialogs
- ✅ Metadata processor updated
- ✅ Settings tab UI toggle added
- ✅ Persistence to YAML files implemented
- ✅ Import issues fixed

## Recommendations

1. **Keep strict mode enabled** - Protects your account
2. **Configure PacketStream** - Required for YouTube operations with strict mode
3. **Only disable for testing** - Understand the risks before disabling

## Migration Notes

- Existing users: Strict mode will be **enabled by default** on next launch
- If PacketStream not configured: YouTube operations will be blocked
- Users will see clear instructions on how to configure or disable
- No breaking changes to existing functionality when proxy is working

## Technical Details

### Error Flow
1. User initiates YouTube download/metadata operation
2. System checks if proxy is configured
3. If not, checks `proxy_strict_mode` setting
4. If strict mode enabled: Block operation with `ProcessorResult(success=False)`
5. If strict mode disabled: Log warning and proceed with direct connection

### Logging
All strict mode blocks include:
- 🚫 Emoji prefix for visibility
- Clear reason (IP protection)
- Actionable fix instructions
- Alternative option (disable strict mode)

### Default Safety
The system defaults to the safest option (strict mode enabled) to prevent accidental IP exposure, following the principle of "secure by default."
