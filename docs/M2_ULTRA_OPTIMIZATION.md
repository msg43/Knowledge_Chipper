# M2 Ultra Optimization Guide

## 🚀 Sophisticated Constraints for "Silky" Performance

This document outlines the advanced optimization strategies implemented for M2 Ultra systems to achieve maximum performance while maintaining stability.

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

### Single Model, Multiple Workers
```
Qwen2.5-14B-instruct FP16 Model: 32GB (shared by all workers)
├── Model weights: 32GB (shared read-only access)
├── Worker 1: KV cache ~0.4GB (2k ctx) / ~0.9GB (4k ctx) / ~1.8GB (8k ctx)
├── Worker 2: KV cache ~0.4GB (2k ctx) / ~0.9GB (4k ctx) / ~1.8GB (8k ctx)
├── ...
└── Worker N: KV cache (per-request isolation)

Total RAM: 32GB (model) + Σ(KV cache per worker)
Available headroom: 64GB - total usage = ~30GB+ for system
```

## 🎯 Critical Constraints Beyond CPU & RAM

### 1. KV Cache Budget Management

**The Problem**: KV cache scales with `num_ctx` and can silently burn GBs per worker.

**Qwen2.5-14B Per Concurrent Request**:
- 2k ctx ≈ 0.3–0.5 GB
- 4k ctx ≈ 0.8–1.0 GB  
- 8k ctx ≈ 1.6–2.0 GB

**Our Solution**:
```python
# Context limits enforced per stage
stage_a_max_ctx = 4000  # Stage-A (Mining): 2-4k ctx
stage_b_max_ctx = 8000  # Stage-B (Evaluation): ~8k ctx

# KV cache budget calculation
available_ram = 64GB - 32GB (model) - 2GB (system) = 30GB
kv_cache_budget = 30GB * 0.8 = 24GB  # 80% for KV cache
max_workers_stage_a = 24GB / 0.9GB = ~26 workers (4k ctx)
max_workers_stage_b = 24GB / 1.8GB = ~13 workers (8k ctx)
```

### 2. Thread Contention Limits

**The Real Bottleneck**: Total active inference threads, not just workers.

**M2 Ultra Thread Limits**:
- 24 CPU cores
- Optimal ceiling: 32–40 total inference threads
- Sweet spot: 6–8 workers × 4–6 threads each

**Our Solution**:
```python
max_total_inference_threads = 36  # M2 Ultra ceiling
max_threads_per_worker = 6       # Max threads per worker

# Thread usage calculation
total_threads = Σ(workers × threads_per_worker)
if total_threads > 36:
    reduce_workers_or_threads_per_worker()
```

### 3. Model Residency Management

**The Problem**: Autoscalers sometimes spin up "almost-the-same" models, loading duplicate 32GB copies.

**Our Solution**:
```python
# Force both stages to use exact same model tag
model_tag = "qwen2.5:14b-instruct"  # Consistent across all operations

# Keep model loaded between bursts
keep_alive = True  # Prevent weight unloading
```

## 📊 Advanced Monitoring Signals

### 1. CPU Utilization & Run Queue Length
```python
# Don't just look at CPU % - watch runnable threads
if run_queue_length > cpu_cores * 2:
    back_off_workers_or_threads()
```

### 2. Unified Memory Pressure (macOS Metric)
```python
# Use macOS memory pressure, not raw "free RAM"
memory_pressure_factor = {
    "green": 1.0,    # < 60% - No pressure
    "yellow": 0.7,   # 60-80% - Moderate pressure  
    "orange": 0.5,   # 80-90% - High pressure
    "red": 0.3       # > 90% - Critical pressure
}
```

### 3. Tail Latency Monitoring
```python
# P95/P99 latency per request type
if p95_latency > 5.0 and cpu_usage < 80%:
    # Thread oversubscription - drop threads/parallelism
    reduce_threads_per_worker()
```

### 4. Token Throughput Tracking
```python
# Falling tokens/sec at same load = past knee of curve
if token_throughput < 100:  # tokens/sec
    reduce_parallelism()
```

## 🛡️ Guardrails for "Boringly Reliable" Performance

### 1. Concurrency Bands
```python
# Stage-A: 4-8 workers allowed
# Stage-B: max 1 worker (sequential evaluation)
# Let scaler slide within bands, not beyond
stage_a_workers = clamp(workers, 4, 8)
stage_b_workers = min(workers, 1)
```

### 2. Hard Cap on Total Threads
```python
# Hard cap: 36 threads total
if adding_worker_would_exceed_36_threads():
    queue_request_instead()
```

### 3. Request Shaping
```python
# Keep outputs tiny JSON and prompts lean
output_schema = "compact_json"  # No streaming unless needed
prompt_length = "minimal"       # Lean prompts
temperature = 0                 # Deterministic output
```

### 4. Schema Discipline
```python
# Always enforce JSON Schema + temperature: 0
# Retry once on validation fail, then log and move on
if json_validation_fails():
    retry_once()
    if still_fails():
        log_and_skip()
```

### 5. Backoff on Error Spikes
```python
# If validation failures exceed threshold, reduce concurrency
if validation_failures > 5:
    reduce_concurrency_by_1_to_2_steps()
```

## 📈 Performance Envelope for M2 Ultra

└── Stability: "Boringly reliable"
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Dynamic Scaling Logic
```python
def calculate_optimal_workers(job_type, current_conditions):
    # 1. KV Cache Budget Constraint
    kv_budget = available_ram * 0.8 / kv_per_worker
    
    # 2. Thread Contention Constraint  
    thread_budget = (36 - current_threads) / threads_per_worker
    
    # 3. Memory Pressure Factor
    pressure_factor = memory_pressure_factor(memory_percent)
    
    # 4. Performance Factor (latency/throughput)
    perf_factor = performance_factor(p95_latency, token_throughput)
    
    # 5. Error Rate Factor
    error_factor = error_factor(validation_failures)
    
    # Apply all constraints
    optimal_workers = min(
        base_workers,
        kv_budget,
        thread_budget,
        max_workers * pressure_factor * perf_factor * error_factor
    )
    
    return max(min_workers, optimal_workers)
```

## 🎯 Result: "Silky" Performance

With these sophisticated constraints, the dynamic parallelization system:

✅ **Respects KV cache per worker** (won't "helpfully" expand num_ctx)  
✅ **Enforces total thread cap** (prevents Thread-Thunderdome)  
✅ **Guarantees one loaded model tag** (no duplicate 32GB weights)  
✅ **Monitors advanced signals** (memory pressure, tail latency, throughput)  
✅ **Implements guardrails** (concurrency bands, error backoff)  

**Result**: The autoscaler doesn't just "work" — it stays fast, stable, and pleasantly boring on M2 Ultra systems.
