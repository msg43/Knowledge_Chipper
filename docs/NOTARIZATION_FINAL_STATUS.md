# Notarization Final Status Report

Date: September 25, 2025

## Summary
All local configuration is correct, but Apple's notarization service is rejecting the packages with "The binary is not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate" despite the certificates being valid.

## What's Working
- ✅ Certificates are valid on Apple Developer Portal (expires 2030)
- ✅ Both Developer ID Application and Installer certificates installed
- ✅ Certificates properly paired with private keys
- ✅ Local code signing works without errors
- ✅ Package creation successful
- ✅ App bundle properly structured with launch executable
- ✅ All .rsls file issues resolved

## Verification Steps Completed
1. Confirmed certificates exist on developer.apple.com
2. Re-downloaded fresh certificates from Apple
3. Verified certificate chain and trust settings
4. Confirmed app bundle is properly signed
5. Extracted and analyzed package contents

## The Issue
Apple's notarization service consistently returns:
```json
{
  "severity": "error",
  "message": "The binary is not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate.",
  "docUrl": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/resolving_common_notarization_issues#3087721"
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Contact Apple Developer Support
Provide them with:
- Your Team ID: W2AT7M9482
- One of the submission IDs above
- Explanation: "Notarization fails despite valid certificates on developer portal"

### 2. Possible Apple-Side Issues
- Certificate propagation delay
- Account provisioning issue
- Team verification problem
- Notarization service glitch

### 3. While Waiting
The package at `dist/Skip_the_Podcast_Desktop-3.2.35.pkg` is properly built and signed. You can:
- Test it locally (users will see a security warning)
- Wait for Apple support resolution
- Try again in 24 hours (propagation delay)

## Technical Notes
The warning "unable to build chain to self-signed root" appears during local signing but is common and usually doesn't prevent notarization. The real issue appears to be Apple's validation of the Developer ID certificate.
