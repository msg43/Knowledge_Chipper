  00:01:10.530        07  Sokolov, and I represent the Cerdito family in this
  00:01:13.120        08  case.  Before we get started I just want to go
  00:01:16.350        09  through the ground rules of deposition to make sure
  00:01:18.430        10  that we're on the same page.
  00:01:20.860        11                  Could you please state your full
  00:01:22.030        12  name for the record?
  00:01:23.540        13         A.   Maxine Schlecht Wolf.
  00:01:27.540        14         Q.   And do you understand that you are under
  00:01:29.090        15  oath and that being under oath means you are sworn to
  00:01:32.250        16  tell the truth?
  00:01:34.035        17         A.   Yes.
  00:01:34.630        18         Q.   Have you ever had your deposition taken
  00:01:38.400        19  in the past?
  00:01:39.120        20         A.   No.
  00:01:39.300        21         Q.   You understand that your responses here
  00:01:41.660        22  have the same force as they would in a courtroom with
  00:01:43.800        23  a judge and a jury?
  00:01:45.490        24         A.   I do.
  00:01:48.040  00006:01         Q.   Is there any reason, such as being under
  00:01:50.340        02  unusual stress, a mental or physical condition, or
  00:01:53.760        03  being under the influence of any substance, that
  00:01:56.280        04  would prevent or limit you today from giving truthful
  00:01:59.060        05  answers to my questions?
  00:02:02.531        06         A.   No.
  00:02:02.940        07         Q.   There is nothing wrong with asking me to
  00:02:04.430        08  repeat a question or explain a term if you don't
  00:02:06.700        09  understand my question.  However, if you answer my
  00:02:09.700        10  question, I'm going to assume that you understood it.
  00:02:12.460        11  Do you understand this?
  00:02:13.760        12         A.   Yes, I understand.
  00:02:15.990        13         Q.   And if you need to take a break at any
  00:02:17.860        14  time, just tell me and we can take a break.  Is that
  00:02:21.279        15  okay?
  00:02:21.590        16         A.   That's fine.
  00:02:23.920        17         Q.   Before your deposition did you review any
  00:02:26.360        18  documents in preparation?
  00:02:31.162        19         A.   No.
  00:02:31.620        20         Q.   Okay.  What is your date of birth?

  00:02:56.500        06         Q.   Have you ever been convicted of a crime?

  00:03:00.220        08         Q.   Have you ever been involved in any other
  00:03:01.950        09  legal claims or lawsuits?
  00:03:06.000        10         A.   No.
  00:03:06.450        11         Q.   And what is your current occupation?
  00:03:09.230        12         A.   I'm the president and CEO of Wolf
  00:03:11.860        13  Development, Inc.
  00:03:15.090        14         Q.   When did you begin employment with Wolf
  00:03:17.570        15  Development?
  00:03:18.480        16         A.   When I founded it.
  00:03:20.790        17         Q.   Do you remember what year you founded it?
  00:03:25.550        18         A.   Somewhere around 2008.
  00:03:28.500        19         Q.   And when you first became associated with
  00:03:31.460        20  Wolf Development, what capacity was it in?
  00:03:34.610        21         A.   I founded it.  It's my company.
  00:03:38.410        22         Q.   And what type of work does Wolf
  00:03:39.770        23  Development do?  Can you give me examples of the type
  00:03:42.000        24  of projects you're involved in?
  00:03:43.330  00008:01         A.   Sure.  We specialize in acquiring
  00:03:48.690        02  underused properties I would say that aren't
  00:03:52.070        03  maximizing their potential.  We turn them into
  00:03:54.400        04  something that is more appealing, interesting for the
  00:03:57.540        05  community.  You might say we pave paradise and put up
  00:04:02.310        06  a different type of paradise.
  00:04:06.160        07         Q.   Are you acquainted with the Cerdito
  00:04:07.840        08  siblings -- Brutus, Mallory, and Cassidy Cerdito --
  00:04:11.560        09  who reside in the Campbell-Walton corridor?
  00:04:16.120        10         A.   Somewhat acquainted, yes.
  00:04:18.580        11         Q.   What is your relationship with the
  00:04:20.140        12  Cerdito family?
  00:04:21.390        13         A.   I attempted to work with them to acquire
  00:04:24.600        14  their property for a new development.
  00:04:27.330        15         Q.   Have you worked with them before this?
  00:04:30.458        16         A.   No.
  00:04:30.730        17         Q.   And how did you attempt to contact them?
  00:04:33.170        18         A.   I reached out via e-mail to make a
  00:04:34.980        19  generous offer on properties they were not
  00:04:38.324        20  maximizing.
  00:04:39.610        21         Q.   And how did you obtain the Cerditos'
  00:04:41.180        22  e-mail addresses?
  00:04:42.660        23         A.   They were from a promotional marketing
  00:04:45.420        24  database we had completely legal access to.
  00:04:50.230  00009:01         Q.   Did you ever meet them in person?
  00:04:53.140        02         A.   No, I don't believe I did.
  00:04:55.810        03         Q.   So you've never been to their homes?
  00:04:57.850        04         A.   I did.  I stopped by, but no one answered
  00:05:00.450        05  the door.
  00:05:02.680        06         MS. SOKOLOV:  I'd like to enter Exhibit 1
  00:05:04.940        07  into evidence, Bates No. TLP0011.  This is an e-mail
  00:05:11.140        08  conversation between Ms. Wolf and Brutus Cerdito that
  00:05:14.650        09  took place on March 14th and March 15th, 2006 [sic].
  00:05:16.860        10  BY MS. SOKOLOV:
  00:05:19.070        11         Q.   Ms. Wolf, here is a copy of the e-mail.
  00:05:23.140        12  Do you recognize it?
  00:05:30.083        13         A.   Yes.
  00:05:31.570        14         Q.   Ms. Wolf, can you please read the top
  00:05:33.460        15  paragraph on the page starting "I have some friends
  00:05:37.430        16  in the building inspector's office" for me?
  00:05:41.150        17         A.   "I have some friends in the building
  00:05:42.680        18  inspector's office that would be very interested in
  00:05:46.080        19  how you've constructed this home with shoddy
  00:05:48.080        20  materials and no permits.  And it would be a shame if
  00:05:52.450        21  it got blown down in the storm that's being forecast
  00:05:55.390        22  for overnight tonight."
  00:05:58.650        23         Q.   And what was your intent in writing that
  00:06:02.334        24  e-mail?
  00:06:02.590  00010:01         A.   I wanted to make sure that Mr. Cerdito
  00:06:05.670        02  was aware of the dire circumstances he placed himself
  00:06:09.870        03  in by failing to keep his house up.
  00:06:13.320        04         Q.   Were you threatening Mr. Cerdito with
  00:06:14.970        05  consequences if he didn't sell his property to you?
  00:06:17.760        06         A.   Absolutely not.  If he felt threatened,
  00:06:19.510        07  it's his own fault for not keeping up his house.
  00:06:22.380        08         Q.   What is your opinion of people who live
  00:06:23.990        09  in substandard housing conditions?
  00:06:28.560        10         A.   Some say that the standard you live in
  00:06:30.860        11  reflects the standard of your life.
  00:06:33.980        12         Q.   And you took special pleasure in trying
  00:06:35.670        13  to remove the Cerdito siblings from their homes;
  00:06:38.220        14  isn't that right, Mrs. Wolf?
  00:06:39.530        15         A.   I wouldn't say that exactly, no.
  00:06:41.570        16         Q.   You think they don't deserve to live
  00:06:43.350        17  there; isn't that correct?
  00:06:44.830        18         MR. VIENTO:  Objection.  Harassment.
  00:06:45.600        19  BY MS. SOKOLOV:
  00:06:46.370        20         Q.   Okay.  I'll move on.
  00:06:50.190        21                  Ms. Wolf, what made you so
  00:06:51.590        22  interested in acquiring the three properties at 915,
  00:06:55.120        23  917, and 919 Campbell?
  00:06:58.580        24         A.   It's my job.  It's my passion.  I'm -- I
  00:07:02.900  00011:01  guess I'm always on the hunt for something new to
  00:07:05.439        02  develop.
  00:07:06.010        03         Q.   But you had a special interest in
  00:07:07.800        04  acquiring these three properties; isn't that right?
  00:07:10.400        05         A.   Yes.  They're very appealing and in a
  00:07:12.660        06  great location.
  00:07:14.640        07         Q.   Did you have any plans for these
  00:07:17.808        08  properties?
  00:07:18.960        09         A.   My mind is always filled with plans for
  00:07:22.172        10  properties.
  00:07:23.090        11         Q.   Ms. Wolf, are you aware of the proposal
  00:07:24.950        12  for a new barbecue restaurant on the properties owned
  00:07:27.510        13  by the Cerdito siblings?
  00:07:28.960        14         A.   Oh, yes.  Yeah, I've heard rumblings of
  00:07:31.943        15  this.
  00:07:32.370        16         Q.   But did you have specific plans to
  00:07:34.750        17  participate in the development of the barbecue
  00:07:37.306        18  restaurant?
  00:07:37.860        19         A.   I wouldn't say I had specific plans, but
  00:07:40.760        20  all ideas are on the table, sure.
  00:07:43.920        21         MS. SOKOLOV:  I'd like to enter Exhibit 2
  00:07:45.550        22  into evidence, Bates No. TLP0015.  This is a series
  00:07:52.540        23  of e-mails between Ms. Wolf and two colleagues at
  00:07:56.270        24  Wolf Development, Hunter Requin and Tanith -- Tanith
  00:08:01.722  00012:01  Drake.
  00:08:02.141        02  BY MS. SOKOLOV:
  00:08:02.560        03         Q.   Ms. Wolf, what is your relationship with
  00:08:05.129        04  Mr. Requin?
  00:08:05.660        05         A.   Hunter has been my vice president of
  00:08:07.280        06  property management for the past five years.
  00:08:09.910        07         Q.   And what is your relationship with
  00:08:11.724        08  Ms. Drake?
  00:08:12.230        09         A.   She is our manager for investments and
  00:08:16.748        10  acquisitions.
  00:08:18.360        11         Q.   Ms. Wolf, do you recognize these e-mails?
  00:08:24.070        12         A.   I do.
  00:08:27.200        13         Q.   Would you please read the initial e-mail
  00:08:28.970        14  from March 12th, 2016?  You'll find that on Page 2 of
  00:08:33.030        15  this printout.
  00:08:36.070        16         A.   "I may have identified a prime location
  00:08:38.260        17  to build our barbecue joint.  When you can, go drive
  00:08:43.020        18  by 915 and 917 Campbell.  The current structures are
  00:08:47.320        19  sorely in need of big repairs, so it would be much
  00:08:50.070        20  easier to buy them out and redevelop."
  00:08:54.120        21         Q.   So based on this e-mail it sounds like
  00:08:56.270        22  you were highly motivated to build the BBQ restaurant
  00:08:58.920        23  on these properties; isn't that true?
  00:09:01.720        24         A.   I guess you could say that.
  00:09:04.700  00013:01         Q.   Ms. Wolf, are you aware that the two
  00:09:06.250        02  properties belonging to Mallory and Brutus Cerdito at
  00:09:09.030        03  915 and 917 Campbell were both destroyed soon after
  00:09:13.250        04  you reached out with an offer to purchase them?
  00:09:15.990        05         A.   I do remember.  There were terrible
  00:09:17.690        06  storms that night.  It was so awful.  I lost all my
  00:09:21.020        07  rose bushes.  It was terrible.
  00:09:24.470        08         Q.   Are the storms you're referencing the
  00:09:25.710        09  storms of March 15th and March 16th, 2016?
  00:09:31.210        10         A.   I -- sure, that sounds right, yeah.
  00:09:33.120        11         Q.   And were you in Hammington on either of
  00:09:35.130        12  those nights in 2016?
  00:09:36.930        13         A.   I believe so, yes, but I likely slept
  00:09:39.350        14  through the storms.
  00:09:41.350        15         Q.   You say you slept through the storms on
  00:09:42.990        16  both of the nights?
  00:09:44.290        17         A.   Like a baby, yeah.
  00:09:45.850        18         Q.   And during what hours of the evening were
  00:09:47.790        19  you asleep?
  00:09:49.300        20         A.   Most likely 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.  Early
  00:09:52.380        21  to bed, early to rise, that's me.
  00:09:55.960        22         Q.   So you were in your home when the storms
  00:09:57.750        23  came through Hammington in the late evening of both
  00:10:00.640        24  March 15th and March 16th?
  00:10:02.640  00014:01         MR. VIENTO:  Objection.  Asked and answered.
  00:10:03.795        02  BY MS. SOKOLOV:
  00:10:04.950        03         Q.   Okay.  Moving on, Ms. Wolf were you
  00:10:08.100        04  actively involved in the destruction of properties at
  00:10:11.110        05  915 and 917 Campbell?
  00:10:14.100        06         A.   Absolutely not.  It was an act of nature.
  00:10:18.570        07         MS. SOKOLOV:  I'd like to enter Exhibit 3
  00:10:20.350        08  into evidence, Bates No. TLP0017.  This is a sales
  00:10:25.750        09  receipt from a company named Fans R Us.
  00:10:27.415        10  BY MS. SOKOLOV:
  00:10:29.080        11         Q.   Ms. Wolf, I'm going to hand you a copy of
  00:10:30.630        12  this receipt.  Can you please read me the description
  00:10:34.190        13  of what was purchased?
  00:10:36.430        14         A.   This is for a super industrial-grade wind
  00:10:40.791        15  machine.
  00:10:41.700        16         Q.   And can you please tell me who was listed
  00:10:43.540        17  as the purchaser under "Sold To"?
  00:10:45.910        18         A.   Wolf Development, Inc.
  00:10:48.410        19         Q.   Thank you.  And can you please read the
  00:10:50.040        20  date for me?
  00:10:51.350        21         A.   March 15th, 2016.
  00:10:54.630        22         Q.   Ms. Wolf, did you purchase this wind
  00:10:56.370        23  machine on March 15th, 2016?
  00:10:58.430        24         A.   Of course I did.
  00:11:00.040  00015:01         Q.   And what was the reason you purchased
  00:11:01.750        02  such a device?
  00:11:03.140        03         A.   You might be aware my company has been
  00:11:05.330        04  finishing up work over the last several years, lots
  00:11:08.060        05  of current projects simultaneously going on.  We were
  00:11:11.540        06  having trouble with the paint that we'd purchased
  00:11:13.840        07  seems to not want to dry because of the humidity.  I
  00:11:16.850        08  was trying to speed things up with this machine.
  00:11:19.800        09         Q.   So the purpose of this industrial-grade
  00:11:22.050        10  wind machine was to dry paint?
  00:11:23.990        11         A.   I don't know if it's its expressed
  00:11:25.890        12  purpose, but I was willing to try anything.  Okay?
  00:11:29.490        13         Q.   Ms. Wolf, are you aware that the machine
  00:11:31.530        14  of this size could easily be used to destroy a home
  00:11:34.700        15  built out of substandard materials, materials like
  00:11:37.780        16  recycled hay or industrial compressed wood shavings?
  00:11:42.210        17         A.   I suppose anything is possible.
  00:11:45.150        18         Q.   And do you think it's possible that a
  00:11:46.510        19  machine like this could have been used to destroy the
  00:11:49.300        20  homes of Mallory and Brutus Cerdito?
  00:11:51.290        21         A.   This machine was used for drying paint.
  00:11:53.790        22  I thought we already established that the storms are
  00:11:56.270        23  what caused the two homes to blow over.
  00:11:59.190        24         Q.   I'd like to return to Exhibit 2 again,
  00:12:01.440  00016:01  the e-mail conversation between you and your
  00:12:03.570        02  colleagues, Mr. Requin and Ms. Drake.
  00:12:05.409        03                  Ms. Wolf, can you please take a look
  00:12:07.430        04  again at the printout and the read the first
  00:12:09.610        05  paragraph of the e-mail you sent to your colleague on
  00:12:12.100        06  March 17th, 2016 starting with the words "Our luck"?
  00:12:17.620        07         A.   "Our luck has been unbelievable.  Last
  00:12:20.710        08  night's second unnatural windstorm has blown down the
  00:12:24.590        09  wooden house at 917.  We must work now to secure for
  00:12:28.750        10  the 919 lot.  Our barbecue joint will be the
  00:12:32.010        11  quintessential hipster hangout once we get the full
  00:12:35.630        12  patio in place."
  00:12:37.890        13         Q.   Ms. Wolf, what did you mean when you used
  00:12:40.010        14  the word "unnatural" to describe the storm?
  00:12:42.790        15         A.   It was just a really strong storm,
  00:12:45.470        16  nothing more than that.
  00:12:47.730        17         Q.   In your e-mail you mentioned your
  00:12:49.130        18  unbelievable luck to your colleagues despite the
  00:12:51.860        19  tragic destruction that occurred to the Cerditos.
  00:12:54.290        20  Don't you think it's quite a coincidence that the
  00:12:56.210        21  homes were blown down on the two properties you were
  00:12:59.330        22  trying to acquire and that this happened within less
  00:13:01.850        23  than 48 hours of your purchase of a super
  00:13:04.350        24  industrial-grade wind machine that was capable of
  00:13:07.030  00017:01  causing that exact kind of damage?
  00:13:09.180        02         A.   All I know is I had a lot of wet paint to
  00:13:11.740        03  dry.  And as for my luck, I've always been lucky.
  00:13:17.750        04         Q.   Okay.  Ms. Wolf, I'm going to ask you
  00:13:19.170        05  directly:  Did you or anyone on your behalf use an
  00:13:21.900        06  industrial-strength wind machine to cause destruction
  00:13:24.690        07  to the homes of Mallory and Brutus Cerdito?
  00:13:27.230        08         A.   No, absolutely not.  Those homes were in
  00:13:29.640        09  such bad shape that all anyone had to do is walk by,
  00:13:33.230        10  huff and pluff -- puff, and they would blow them
  00:13:37.946        11  right in.
  00:13:38.820        12         MS. SOKOLOV:  Okay.  I think I have all my
  00:13:40.150        13  answers.  No further questions.
