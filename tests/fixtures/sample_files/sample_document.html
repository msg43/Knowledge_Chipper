    <h1>Sample Document for Summarization Testing</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is a sample HTML document created for testing the summarization functionality
        of the Knowledge Chipper system. The document contains several paragraphs of text
        that should be processed and summarized by the AI model.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence has become increasingly important in modern software development.
        Large language models like GPT, Claude, and others are being used for a variety of tasks
        including code generation, documentation writing, and content summarization.
    </p>

    <p>
        The process of summarization involves taking longer text and extracting the key points
        and main ideas. This can be done extractively (selecting important sentences) or
        abstractively (generating new text that captures the essence).
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>
        Modern summarization systems often use transformer-based architectures. These models
        are pre-trained on large corpora of text and then fine-tuned for specific tasks.
        The attention mechanism allows them to focus on the most relevant parts of the input.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Summarization technology continues to improve and find new applications across
        various domains including news, research, and business intelligence.
