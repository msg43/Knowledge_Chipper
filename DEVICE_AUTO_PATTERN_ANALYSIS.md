# Device "auto" Pattern Analysis

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Issue Class:** String-based device selection with "auto" passed to PyTorch  
**Status:** ✅ Active bugs fixed, ⚠️ Dormant bugs identified

---

## The Problem Class

### Core Issue
PyTorch's `torch.device()` expects specific device strings: `"cpu"`, `"cuda"`, `"cuda:0"`, `"mps"`, etc.  
It does **NOT** accept `"auto"` as a valid device string.

However, "auto" is a useful abstraction for **user-facing** settings, meaning "detect and use the best available device."

### The Pattern
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Passing "auto" directly to PyTorch
device = "auto"  # From user settings
torch_device = torch.device(device)  # ERROR!

# ✅ CORRECT - Resolve "auto" before PyTorch
device = "auto"  # From user settings
if device == "auto" or device is None:
    device = detect_best_device()  # Returns "cpu", "cuda", or "mps"
torch_device = torch.device(device)  # Works!
```

---

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Diarization Processor
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/processors/diarization.py`

**Problem:**
```python
# Line 86 (BEFORE)
self.device = device or self._detect_best_device()
```
If `device == "auto"`, it would be used directly, causing PyTorch error.

**Fix:**
```python
# Line 87-90 (AFTER)
if device == "auto" or device is None:
    self.device = self._detect_best_device()
else:
    self.device = device
```

**Impact:** HIGH - This was causing the actual error user reported

---

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Settings Manager
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/core/settings_manager.py`

**Problem:**
```python
# Line 158-160 (BEFORE)
elif combo_name == "device":
    return (
        "auto" if self.system_settings.transcription.use_gpu else "cpu"
    )
```
Incorrectly mapping boolean to "auto" string.

**Fix:**
```python
# Line 157-159 (AFTER)
elif combo_name == "device":
    # Use the device field directly (auto, cpu, cuda, mps)
    return self.system_settings.transcription.device
```

**Impact:** HIGH - Root cause of the bug

---

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Config Schema
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/config.py`

**Problem:**
Config only had `use_gpu: bool`, but GUI needed `device: str` with enum values.

**Fix:**
```python
# Line 220-224 (ADDED)
device: str = Field(
    default="auto",
    pattern="^(auto|cpu|cuda|mps)$",
    description="Processing device: auto (detect best), cpu, cuda (NVIDIA), mps (Apple Silicon)"
)
```

**Impact:** HIGH - Architectural fix for type alignment

---

## Dormant Bugs Found (Not Currently Active)

### 4. ✅ FIXED (Proactively): Device Selection Utility
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/utils/device_selection.py`

**Problem:**
```python
# Line 81-83 (BEFORE)
# AMD ROCm support (basic)
if specs.supports_rocm:
    logger.info("Selected ROCm for AMD GPU acceleration")
    return "auto"  # Let PyTorch handle ROCm detection
```

This function returned "auto" for ROCm, which would cause the same PyTorch error.

**Why It Was Dormant:**
```bash
$ grep -r "select_optimal_device" src/
# No results - function is not imported or used anywhere
```

**Fix:**
```python
# Line 81-83 (AFTER)
# AMD ROCm support (basic)
if specs.supports_rocm:
    logger.info("Selected ROCm for AMD GPU acceleration")
    return "cuda"  # ROCm uses CUDA-compatible API
```

**Impact:** LOW - Code is unused, but fixed proactively to prevent future issues

## Systematic Audit Results

### All Device-Related Code Paths

#### ✅ Safe: AudioProcessor
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/processors/audio_processor.py`

```python
# Line 74
self.device = device
```

**Analysis:** 
- Stores device as-is
- Passes to `SpeakerDiarizationProcessor` which now handles "auto" correctly
- Does NOT pass to PyTorch directly (uses whisper.cpp)
- **Status:** SAFE

---

#### ✅ Safe: WhisperCppTranscribeProcessor
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/processors/whisper_cpp_transcribe.py`

```python
# Line 1725
device = kwargs.get("device", None)
```

**Analysis:**
- Extracts device from kwargs
- Does NOT use PyTorch (uses whisper.cpp with Core ML)
- Device parameter is for API compatibility only
- **Status:** SAFE

---

#### ✅ Safe: Model Preloader
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/components/model_preloader.py`

```python
# Line 66
self.device = None
```

**Analysis:**
- Stores device setting
- Passes to processors which handle "auto" resolution
- Does not call `torch.device()` directly
- **Status:** SAFE

---

#### ✅ Safe: Process Tab Worker
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/process_tab.py`

```python
# Line 162
audio_processor = AudioProcessor(
    device=self.config.get("device", "cpu"),
    ...
)
```

**Analysis:**
- Gets device from config
- Passes to AudioProcessor → SpeakerDiarizationProcessor
- Now handled correctly by diarization fix
- **Status:** SAFE

---

#### ✅ Safe: Unified Batch Processor
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/processors/unified_batch_processor.py`

```python

- Now handled correctly
- **Status:** SAFE

---

#### ⚠️ Dormant: Device Selection Utility
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/utils/device_selection.py`

```python
# Line 83
return "auto"  # For ROCm
```

**Analysis:**
- Returns "auto" for ROCm support
- Would cause PyTorch error if used
- Currently unused in codebase
- **Status:** DORMANT BUG - Should fix proactively

## Pattern Recognition

### Where "auto" is Valid
1. ✅ **User-facing settings** (GUI combo boxes, YAML config)
2. ✅ **High-level APIs** (as input to functions that resolve it)
3. ✅ **Configuration schemas** (with enum validation)

### Where "auto" is Invalid
1. ❌ **PyTorch APIs** (`torch.device()`, `.to()`, etc.)
2. ❌ **Return values from device detection** (must be concrete)
3. ❌ **Direct hardware operations** (must specify actual device)

### The Resolution Pattern
```python
def __init__(self, device: str | None = None):
    # ALWAYS resolve "auto" before storing
    if device == "auto" or device is None:
        self.device = self._detect_best_device()  # Returns concrete device
    else:
        self.device = device
    
    # Now self.device is guaranteed to be concrete
    # Safe to pass to PyTorch
```

## Search Patterns for Similar Bugs

### 1. Direct PyTorch Device Creation
```bash
grep -r "torch.device(" src/
```
**Check:** Is the device string validated before this call?

### 2. Device Parameter Defaults
```bash
grep -r "device.*=.*None" src/
```
**Check:** Is None properly resolved to concrete device?

### 3. Device String Returns
```bash
grep -r 'return "auto"' src/
```
**Check:** Is this return value passed to PyTorch?

### 4. Config-to-Code Mappings
```bash
grep -r "get.*device" src/
```
**Check:** Is config value resolved before use?

## Prevention Strategy

### For New Code

#### 1. Device Parameter Pattern
```python
def __init__(self, device: str | None = None):
    """
    Args:
        device: Processing device. Use "auto" for automatic detection,
                or specify "cpu", "cuda", "mps" explicitly.
    """
    # ALWAYS resolve at initialization
    if device == "auto" or device is None:
        self.device = self._detect_best_device()
    else:
        self.device = device
    
    # Validate concrete device
    assert self.device in ("cpu", "cuda", "mps"), f"Invalid device: {self.device}"
```

#### 2. Device Detection Function Pattern
```python
def _detect_best_device(self) -> str:
    """
    Detect the best available device.
    
    Returns:
        Concrete device string: "cpu", "cuda", or "mps"
        NEVER returns "auto"
    """
    try:
        import torch
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            return "cuda"
        elif torch.backends.mps.is_available():
            return "mps"
        else:
            return "cpu"
    except Exception:
        return "cpu"
```

#### 3. Config Schema Pattern
```python
device: str = Field(
    default="auto",
    pattern="^(auto|cpu|cuda|mps)$",  # Enum validation
    description="Processing device: auto (detect best), cpu, cuda, mps"
)
```

#### 4. Settings Manager Pattern
```python
# Return config value directly - let processor resolve "auto"
elif combo_name == "device":
    return self.system_settings.transcription.device  # May be "auto"
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases

#### Test 1: "auto" Resolution
```python
def test_auto_device_resolution():
    processor = SpeakerDiarizationProcessor(device="auto")
    assert processor.device in ("cpu", "cuda", "mps")
    assert processor.device != "auto"
```

#### Test 2: None Resolution
```python
def test_none_device_resolution():
    processor = SpeakerDiarizationProcessor(device=None)
    assert processor.device in ("cpu", "cuda", "mps")
    assert processor.device != "auto"
```

#### Test 3: Explicit Device Passthrough
```python
def test_explicit_device():
    processor = SpeakerDiarizationProcessor(device="cpu")
    assert processor.device == "cpu"
```

#### Test 4: PyTorch Compatibility
```python
def test_pytorch_device_creation():
    processor = SpeakerDiarizationProcessor(device="auto")
    import torch
    # Should not raise error
    torch_device = torch.device(processor.device)
    assert torch_device.type in ("cpu", "cuda", "mps")
```

### Code Review Checklist
When reviewing device-related code:
- [ ] Does this code accept "auto" as input?
- [ ] Is "auto" resolved before PyTorch operations?
- [ ] Does the resolution happen at initialization?
- [ ] Is there a fallback for None/invalid devices?
- [ ] Are concrete devices validated?
- [ ] Is the device used with `torch.device()`?

### Similar Pattern Classes to Watch

#### 1. Model Name Resolution
```python
# Similar pattern: "auto" model selection
model = "auto"  # User wants best model for their hardware
# Must resolve to concrete: "tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large"
```

#### 2. Batch Size Resolution
```python
# Similar pattern: "auto" batch size
batch_size = "auto"  # User wants optimal batch size
# Must resolve to concrete: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.
```

#### 3. Provider Resolution
```python
# Similar pattern: "auto" LLM provider
provider = "auto"  # User wants best available provider
# Must resolve to concrete: "openai", "anthropic", "local"
```

### General Principle
**User-facing "auto" must be resolved to concrete values before system APIs.**
