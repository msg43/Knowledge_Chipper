# Better Logging Implementation - Comprehensive Error Diagnosis

## Problem Analysis

The original error message was too generic:
```
‚ùå Diarization failed for TU3VHYDTE10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU3VHYDTE10)
üí° Diarization failed. To fix:

1) Ensure HuggingFace token is set (Settings ‚Üí API Keys).
2) Accept access to pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 on HuggingFace.
3) Verify ffmpeg/ffprobe are installed and on PATH.
4) Check network stability and retry.
```

This generic message doesn't tell us **WHY** it failed or **what specific error occurred**.

## Root Cause

The error handling was **swallowing the actual error details**:

1. **In `diarization.py`**: `ProcessorResult(success=False, errors=[str(e)])` - captures the real error
2. **In `audio_processor.py`**: `logger.warning(f"Diarization failed: {result.errors}")` - logs it but doesn't surface it
3. **In `youtube_transcript.py`**: Generic "Diarization failed" message without the underlying cause

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Error Reporting in YouTube Processor**

**File**: `src/knowledge_system/processors/youtube_transcript.py`

- **Surfaces actual error details** instead of generic messages
- **Provides specific guidance** based on error type:
  - Missing dependencies: `pip install pyannote.audio`
  - Authentication failures: Check HuggingFace token
  - Model access issues: Accept license at HuggingFace
  - Network issues: Check internet connection
  - GPU errors: Switch to CPU processing
  - FFmpeg issues: Ensure FFmpeg installation

### 2. ‚úÖ **Detailed Model Loading Diagnostics**

**File**: `src/knowledge_system/processors/diarization.py`

- **Full traceback logging** for debugging
- **Context-aware error messages** indicating what operation failed:
  - Model loading failures
  - Audio processing failures
  - Authentication issues
- **Debug logging** for HuggingFace token presence and offline mode status

### 3. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Diagnostic Tool**

**File**: `debug_diarization_environment.py`

A standalone diagnostic script that checks:
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables** (PYANNOTE_BUNDLED, HF_TOKEN, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Cache directories** and their contents
- ‚úÖ **Bundled model paths** and availability
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies** and their versions
- ‚úÖ **Model loading test** (both bundled and standard)

## How to Use the New Logging

### For Users on Remote Machines

1. **Run the diagnostic tool first**:
   ```bash
   python debug_diarization_environment.py
   ```

2. **Check the detailed error messages** in the UI/logs that now show:
   - The **actual underlying error**
   - **Specific guidance** for that error type
   - **Context** about what operation failed

### For Developers/Support

1. **Enable debug logging** by setting log level to DEBUG
2. **Check the full traceback** in logs for detailed error information
3. **Use the diagnostic tool** to verify environment setup

## Expected Error Message Improvements

### Before (Generic):
```
‚ùå Diarization failed for TU3VHYDTE10
üí° Diarization failed. To fix: [generic suggestions]
```

### After (Specific):
```
‚ùå Diarization failed: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
üí° HuggingFace authentication failed - check your token in Settings ‚Üí API Keys
```

Or:
```
‚ùå Diarization failed: No module named 'pyannote'
üí° Missing pyannote.audio dependency - install with: pip install pyannote.audio
```

Or:
```
‚ùå Diarization failed: Model loading failed for pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1: Repository not found
üí° Model access denied - accept the license at https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Real Error Visibility**: Users now see the actual underlying error, not just "Diarization failed"
2. **Targeted Solutions**: Each error type gets specific guidance for resolution
3. **Developer Debugging**: Full traceback and context logging for troubleshooting
4. **Proactive Diagnosis**: Standalone tool to check environment before running
5. **Context Awareness**: Error messages indicate which operation failed (model loading vs. processing)

## Next Steps for User

1. **Run the diagnostic tool** on the failing remote machine:
   ```bash
   python debug_diarization_environment.py
   ```

2. **Try diarization again** to see the **specific error message** instead of the generic one

3. **Apply the targeted fix** based on the actual error shown

This should quickly identify whether the issue is:
- Missing bundled models in the DMG
- Authentication problems
- Network connectivity issues  
- Missing dependencies
- Or something else entirely
