Great question! Here's a systematic approach to use LLMs for cleaning up and refactoring your codebase:

## **Step 1: Assess Current State**

Based on my analysis of your codebase, here's a systematic approach to use LLMs for cleaning and refactoring your Knowledge System project:

## **Current State Assessment**

Good news! Your codebase is already relatively clean with:
- ✅ No TODO/FIXME comments in source files
- ✅ Minimal commented-out code
- ✅ Well-structured module organization
- ✅ Good error handling patterns

However, there are opportunities for improvement:

## **Systematic LLM Refactoring Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning**

**Prompt Template:**
```
I have a Python project with [X] files. Please analyze this codebase for:

1. **Code Quality Issues:**
   - Unused imports
   - Dead/unreachable code
   - Duplicate functionality
   - Overly complex functions (>50 lines)
   - Missing type hints
   - Inconsistent naming conventions

2. **Architecture Issues:**
   - Circular imports
   - Tight coupling
   - Missing abstractions
   - Inappropriate dependencies

3. **Cleanup Opportunities:**
   - Functions that can be simplified
   - Classes that violate single responsibility
   - Magic numbers/strings that should be constants

Please prioritize issues by impact and provide a refactoring plan.
```

### **Phase 2: File-by-File Refactoring**

**For each file, use this prompt pattern:**

```
Please refactor this Python file following these principles:

1. **Clean Code:**
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Extract complex logic into smaller functions
   - Add missing type hints
   - Ensure consistent naming (snake_case for functions/variables)
   - Add docstrings where missing

2. **Performance:**
   - Optimize inefficient patterns
   - Remove redundant operations
   - Suggest better data structures if applicable

3. **Maintainability:**
   - Reduce function complexity (max 30 lines)
   - Extract magic numbers to constants
   - Improve error handling
   - Make code more testable

4. **Standards:**
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Use pathlib instead of os.path
   - Modern Python idioms (f-strings, dataclasses, etc.)

Here's the file:
[PASTE FILE CONTENT]

Please provide:
1. The refactored code
2. A summary of changes made
3. Any architectural suggestions
```

### **Phase 3: Specific Focus Areas**

Based on your codebase, focus on these areas:

#### **1. GUI Module (`main_window_pyqt6.py`)**
- **Issue**: 4,700+ lines - very large file
- **LLM Prompt**:
```
This PyQt6 GUI file is 4,700+ lines. Please suggest how to break it into smaller, focused modules:

1. Extract separate classes for each tab's functionality
2. Create a base class for common GUI patterns
3. Move worker functions to separate modules
4. Extract UI creation methods to builder classes

Provide a detailed refactoring plan with new file structure.
```

#### **2. Queue Management System**
- **Current**: Complex queue processing logic spread across multiple methods
- **LLM Prompt**:
```
Please refactor this queue management system to:

1. Create a dedicated QueueProcessor class
2. Implement proper async/await patterns
3. Add comprehensive error recovery
4. Extract status management to separate class
5. Add proper logging and monitoring

Focus on making it more testable and maintainable.
```

### **Phase 4: Architecture Review**

**System-wide Analysis Prompt:**
```
Looking at this entire codebase structure:

[LIST ALL FILES AND THEIR MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES]

Please suggest:

1. **Module Reorganization:**
   - Should any modules be split or combined?
   - Are there missing abstraction layers?
   - How can we reduce coupling between components?

2. **Design Patterns:**
   - Where would Factory, Strategy, or Observer patterns help?
   - Can we implement better separation of concerns?
   - Where should we add interfaces/protocols?

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - How can we consolidate settings handling?
   - Should we use dependency injection?

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Which components need better testability?
   - How can we mock external dependencies?

Provide a modernization roadmap.
```

## **Recommended Tools & Workflow**

### **1. Use Claude/GPT-4 with File Chunks**
```bash
# For large files, break into logical sections:
# - Imports and constants
# - Class definitions (one at a time)
# - Main functions
# - Worker functions
```

### **2. Specific Refactoring Commands**

**Remove unused imports:**
```
Please analyze this Python file and remove all unused imports. Also check for:
- Imported modules that are never used
- Functions imported but only used once (consider inline import)
- Star imports that should be specific
```

**Extract constants:**
```
Find all magic numbers and strings in this code and extract them to properly named constants at the top of the file. Group related constants into an Enum where appropriate.
```

**Type hints:**
```
Add comprehensive type hints to this Python code. Use modern typing features like:
- Union types with | syntax (Python 3.10+)  
- Generic types where applicable
- Protocol for interface definitions
- Proper return type annotations
```

### **3. Progressive Refactoring**

**Week 1**: Core utilities and smaller modules
**Week 2**: Processor classes (one at a time)  
**Week 3**: GUI refactoring (break into pieces)
**Week 4**: Integration testing and cleanup

## **Sample Specific Prompts for Your Code**

**For your GUI file specifically:**
```
This PyQt6 MainWindow class has these major responsibilities:
1. UI creation and layout
2. File processing workflows  
3. Queue management
4. Settings persistence
5. Worker thread management

Please create a refactoring plan that separates these concerns into:
- MainWindow (orchestration only)
- UIBuilder (create layouts)
- WorkflowManager (processing logic)
- QueueController (queue operations)
- SettingsManager (persistence)
- ThreadManager (worker coordination)

Show me the new class structure and interfaces.
```

**For your processors:**
```
I have multiple processor classes (Audio, YouTube, MOC, etc.) that share common patterns. Please:

1. Extract a BaseProcessor abstract class
2. Identify common methods that can be unified
3. Create a ProcessorFactory for creating processors
4. Add proper error handling inheritance
5. Implement a Pipeline pattern for chaining processors

Show the refactored architecture.
```

This approach will give you a clean, maintainable codebase while preserving all functionality!
