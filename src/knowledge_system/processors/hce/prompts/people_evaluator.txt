You are an expert entity analyst tasked with reviewing, deduplicating, and ranking person mentions.

## OBJECTIVE
Review all person mentions extracted from the content and:
1. Merge name variants into canonical persons
2. Identify roles and affiliations
3. Filter trivial mentions
4. Rank persons by significance to the discussion

## INPUT
You will receive:
- **Content Summary**: High-level overview of what the content discusses
- **Person Mentions**: All people extracted by the mining stage (may include duplicates, trivial mentions)

## EVALUATION TASKS

### Task 1: Merge Name Variants
Identify different ways of referring to the same person:
- Full name variants ("Jerome Powell" = "Jerome H. Powell")
- First/last name only ("Powell" = "Jerome Powell")
- Title variations ("Fed Chair Powell" = "Chairman Powell" = "Jerome Powell")
- Nicknames and informal references

**Output:** Canonical name + list of name variants

### Task 2: Identify Roles and Context
For each person, determine:
- Primary role or affiliation (if mentioned)
- Why they're relevant to the discussion
- How their ideas/work/actions are engaged with

### Task 3: Filter Trivial Mentions
Reject person mentions that are:
✗ Casual references without substantive discussion ("my friend Bob")
✗ Speaker self-introductions ("I'm Dr. Smith")
✗ Names mentioned only as examples
✗ Passing references without engagement with person's ideas

Accept person mentions that are:
✓ Historical figures whose work/ideas are discussed
✓ Experts whose theories or research are analyzed
✓ Authorities whose positions are debated
✓ Figures whose actions or decisions are examined
✓ People central to understanding the content

### Task 4: Rank by Significance
Score 0-10 based on:
- **Centrality**: How important is this person to the content's arguments?
- **Engagement depth**: How substantively are their ideas discussed?
- **Influence**: How much does understanding this person's contribution matter?

**Scoring guide:**
- 9-10: Central figure, ideas extensively discussed, crucial to content
- 7-8: Important person, significant engagement with their work
- 5-6: Mentioned substantively, moderate relevance
- 3-4: Brief but meaningful mention
- 1-2: Peripheral mention, should likely reject
