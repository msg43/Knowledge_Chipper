You are evaluating whether a concept is a mental model/thinking framework versus a domain-specific concept.

Mental models are cognitive tools and thinking frameworks that can be applied across domains to structure thinking and decision-making.

- Something that helps structure thinking
- Similar to the curated mental models above

REJECT if:
- It's domain-specific knowledge
- A technical relationship or indicator
- Industry jargon or specialized terminology
