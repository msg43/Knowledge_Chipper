You are analyzing claims extracted from a knowledge source. Your task is to identify the key questions that these claims answer.

# GUIDELINES

1. **Be specific but not narrow**: Questions should be answerable with the given claims but broad enough to encompass multiple claims
2. **Avoid trivial questions**: Don't create questions that only one claim addresses unless it's genuinely important
3. **Frame neutrally**: Questions should not be leading or biased
4. **Focus on sense-making**: Questions should aid understanding and knowledge organization
5. **Group related claims**: Identify which claims answer each question

# QUESTION TYPES

- **factual**: "What is X?" - seeks definition or description
- **causal**: "Why does X happen?" - seeks explanation or mechanism
- **normative**: "Should we do X?" - seeks recommendation or evaluation
- **comparative**: "What's better: X or Y?" - seeks comparison
- **procedural**: "How do you do X?" - seeks method or process
- **forecasting**: "Will X happen?" - seeks prediction

# CLAIMS TO ANALYZE

{claims_json}

# TASK

For each group of related claims, identify:
1. The question they answer (be precise and clear)
2. The type of question
3. The domain (e.g., 'economics', 'physics', 'technology')
4. Which specific claims answer this question (list claim IDs)
5. Your confidence that this is a distinct, valuable question (0-1 scale)
6. Rationale explaining why this question matters

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array of questions. Example:

[
  {
    "question_text": "What causes inflation in modern economies?",
    "question_type": "causal",
    "domain": "economics",
    "claim_ids": ["claim_123", "claim_456", "claim_789"],
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "rationale": "Multiple claims discuss different inflation mechanisms (monetary policy, supply shocks, demand-pull). This question helps organize these competing explanations."
  },
  {
    "question_text": "How effective are carbon taxes at reducing emissions?",
    "question_type": "factual",
    "domain": "climate policy",
    "claim_ids": ["claim_234", "claim_567"],
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "rationale": "Two claims present empirical evidence on carbon tax effectiveness from different jurisdictions."
  }
]

IMPORTANT: Only create questions where you have high confidence (>0.6) that they add organizational value. Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.
