You are reviewing newly discovered questions against an existing question database to identify duplicates and relationships.

# YOUR TASK

For each new question, determine the best action by comparing it to existing questions in the same domain/topic area.

# MERGE ACTIONS

1. **MERGE_INTO_EXISTING**: The new question is a duplicate or subset of an existing question
   - Use when: >80% semantic overlap with existing question
   - Effect: New question will be discarded, claims assigned to existing question

2. **MERGE_EXISTING_INTO_NEW**: An existing question is a subset of the new question
   - Use when: New question is broader/better framed than existing
   - Effect: Existing question archived, claims migrated to new question

3. **LINK_AS_RELATED**: Questions are related but distinct enough to keep separate
   - Use when: 40-80% semantic overlap, different focus/scope
   - Effect: Both questions kept, marked as related

4. **KEEP_DISTINCT**: No significant relationship
   - Use when: <40% semantic overlap
   - Effect: New question added independently

# NEW QUESTIONS

{new_questions_json}

# EXISTING QUESTIONS (filtered by domain/topic)

{existing_questions_json}

# EVALUATION CRITERIA

- **Semantic similarity**: Do they ask the same thing in different words?
- **Scope**: Is one question a subset/superset of the other?
- **Specificity**: Is one more specific/actionable than the other?
- **User value**: Which framing is more useful for navigation?

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array of merge recommendations. Example:

[
  {
    "new_question_text": "What causes inflation?",
    "action": "MERGE_INTO_EXISTING",
    "target_question_id": "q_existing_42",
    "target_question_text": "What causes inflation in modern economies?",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "rationale": "The new question is less specific but asks the same thing. Existing question provides better context with 'in modern economies'."
  },
  {
    "new_question_text": "How do carbon taxes affect economic growth?",
    "action": "LINK_AS_RELATED",
    "target_question_id": "q_existing_18",
    "target_question_text": "How effective are carbon taxes at reducing emissions?",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "rationale": "Related questions about carbon taxes but different focus: economic impact vs emissions reduction. Both valuable independently."
  },
  {
    "new_question_text": "What is the relationship between interest rates and unemployment?",
    "action": "KEEP_DISTINCT",
    "target_question_id": null,
    "target_question_text": null,
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "rationale": "No existing questions cover monetary policy's labor market effects. This is a distinct inquiry."
  }
]

IMPORTANT: Be conservative with merging - when in doubt, keep questions distinct. Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.
