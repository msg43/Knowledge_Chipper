You are assigning claims to questions to create a structured knowledge base organized by inquiry.

# YOUR TASK

For each claim, determine which questions it relates to and how. A claim can relate to multiple questions in different ways.

# RELATION TYPES

1. **answers**: The claim directly answers the question
   - Use for: Direct, complete responses to the question

2. **partial_answer**: The claim addresses one aspect of the question
   - Use for: Claims that answer part but not all of a multi-part question

3. **supports_answer**: The claim provides evidence for an answer
   - Use for: Data, examples, or studies that support but don't state an answer

4. **contradicts**: The claim conflicts with a proposed answer
   - Use for: Alternative views or counter-evidence

5. **prerequisite**: Background knowledge needed to understand the answer
   - Use for: Definitions, context, foundational concepts

6. **follow_up**: The claim raises a related question
   - Use for: Claims that suggest new inquiries

7. **context**: The claim provides framing or scope
   - Use for: Historical background, situational context

# GUIDELINES

- A claim can relate to **multiple questions** with different relation types
- Only assign if genuinely relevant (relevance_score > 0.5)
- Include contradictions - they're valuable for critical thinking!
- Don't force assignments - if a claim doesn't fit any question, skip it
- Provide clear rationale for each assignment

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON array of claim assignments. Example:

[
  {
    "claim_id": "claim_123",
    "question_id": "q_42",
    "relation_type": "answers",
    "relevance_score": 0.95,
    "rationale": "Claim directly states that carbon taxes reduce emissions by 15-20%, which answers the question about effectiveness."
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "claim_123",
    "question_id": "q_87",
    "relation_type": "supports_answer",
    "relevance_score": 0.7,
    "rationale": "The 15-20% reduction statistic provides evidence for the broader question about climate policy effectiveness."
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "claim_456",
    "question_id": "q_42",
    "relation_type": "contradicts",
    "relevance_score": 0.85,
    "rationale": "This claim argues carbon taxes have minimal impact (<5%), contradicting claim_123. Important to capture this disagreement."
  },
  {
    "claim_id": "claim_789",
    "question_id": "q_42",
    "relation_type": "prerequisite",
    "relevance_score": 0.65,
    "rationale": "Defines what constitutes a 'carbon tax' - necessary background for understanding effectiveness claims."
  }
]

IMPORTANT: Be thorough but selective. Assign only when relevance_score > 0.5. Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.
