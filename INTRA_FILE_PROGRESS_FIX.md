# Intra-File Progress Bar Enhancement

## Problem

When transcribing a **single file**, the progress bar would show:
- **0%** during the entire transcription process
- **100%** only when complete

This provided no useful feedback during the actual work. For a 10-minute audio file that takes 2 minutes to transcribe, the user would see 0% for 2 minutes, then suddenly jump to 100%.

## Root Cause

The progress bar was only tracking **completed files**, not progress **within** the current file being processed. The system already had intra-file progress information (from `WhisperCppTranscribeProcessor` and `SpeakerDiarizationProcessor`), but the GUI was ignoring it.

**Flow of Progress Information:**
1. `WhisperCppTranscribeProcessor` reports progress (e.g., "50% complete") → ✅
2. Sent to `_transcription_progress_callback()` in worker → ✅
3. Emitted via `transcription_step_updated` signal with percentage → ✅
4. Received by `_update_transcription_step()` in GUI → ✅
5. **BUT**: Only logged the message, **ignored the percentage** → ❌

## Solution

Added support for **intra-file progress** tracking to the progress bar:

### 1. Added Current File Progress Tracking
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/components/simple_progress_bar.py`

```python
self.current_file_progress = 0  # Track progress within current file (0-100)
```

### 2. Created Update Method for Current File Progress
```python
def update_current_file_progress(self, progress_percent: int):
    """Update progress within the current file being processed (0-100)."""
    self.current_file_progress = max(0, min(100, progress_percent))
    
    # Recalculate total progress including current file contribution
    if self.total_files > 0:
        total_processed = self.completed_files + self.failed_files
        base_percentage = (total_processed / self.total_files) * 100
        
        # Add fractional progress from current file
        if total_processed < self.total_files and self.current_file_progress > 0:
            file_weight = 100 / self.total_files
            current_file_contribution = (self.current_file_progress / 100) * file_weight
            percentage = int(base_percentage + current_file_contribution)
        else:
            percentage = int(base_percentage)
        
        self.progress_bar.setValue(percentage)
```

### 3. Enhanced Overall Progress Calculation
Modified `update_progress()` to include current file progress:

```python
# Base percentage from completed files
base_percentage = (total_processed / self.total_files) * 100

# Add fractional progress from current file being processed
if total_processed < self.total_files and self.current_file_progress > 0:
    file_weight = 100 / self.total_files
    current_file_contribution = (self.current_file_progress / 100) * file_weight
    percentage = int(base_percentage + current_file_contribution)
```

### 4. Connected GUI to Progress Updates
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/transcription_tab.py`

```python
def _update_transcription_step(self, step_description: str, progress_percent: int):
    """Update real-time transcription step display."""
    self.append_log(f"🎤 {step_description}")
    
    # Update intra-file progress in the progress bar
    if hasattr(self, 'progress_display') and progress_percent > 0:
        self.progress_display.update_current_file_progress(progress_percent)
```

### 5. Reset Progress Between Files
```python
# Reset current file progress when a file completes
self.progress_display.current_file_progress = 0
self.progress_display.update_progress(...)
```

## Results

### Single File Transcription
**Before:**
```
0% ────────────────────────────────────► 100%
   ↑                                     ↑
   Start                                 Done
   (2 minutes of 0%)
```

**After:**
```
0% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 90% → 100%
     ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑       ↑
     20s    30s    1m     90s    108s    2m
     (smooth, informative progress!)
```

### Multiple Files (5 files)
**Before:**
```
0% → 20% → 40% → 60% → 80% → 100%
     ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑       ↑
     F1     F2     F3     F4      F5
     (jumps only when files complete)
```

**After:**
```
0% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 27% → 35% → 40% → ... → 100%
     ↑     ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑      ↑
     F1    F1     F1     F2     F2     F2
     25%   50%    ✓      35%    75%    ✓
     (smooth progress within AND between files!)
```

## Test Results

```
=== Single File Test ===
Intra-file 10% → Progress bar shows: 10% ✅
Intra-file 25% → Progress bar shows: 25% ✅
Intra-file 50% → Progress bar shows: 50% ✅
Intra-file 75% → Progress bar shows: 75% ✅
Intra-file 90% → Progress bar shows: 90% ✅
After completion: 100% ✅

=== Five Files Test ===
File 1 at 50% → Progress bar: 10% ✅
  (0 complete + 50% of 20% = 10%)
  
File 1 completes → Progress bar: 20% ✅
  (1/5 = 20%)
  
File 2 at 75% → Progress bar: 35% ✅
  (20% + 75% of 20% = 35%)
  
File 2 completes → Progress bar: 40% ✅
  (2/5 = 40%)
```

## User Benefits

✅ **Single file transcriptions now show meaningful progress**
✅ **Multi-file transcriptions show smooth continuous progress**
✅ **No more "stuck at 0%" frustration**
✅ **Accurate time estimates possible** (user can extrapolate from progress)
✅ **Professional, polished user experience**

## Technical Details

### Progress Calculation Formula

For a batch of N files where M are completed and the current file is P% done:

```
Total Progress = (M / N × 100) + (P / 100 × 100 / N)
               = (M / N × 100) + (P / N)
```

**Example:** 3 of 5 files complete, current file is 60% done:
```
Total Progress = (3 / 5 × 100) + (60 / 5)
               = 60% + 12%
               = 72%
```

### Files Modified

1. **`src/knowledge_system/gui/components/simple_progress_bar.py`**
   - Added `current_file_progress` tracking
   - Added `update_current_file_progress()` method
   - Enhanced `update_progress()` to include intra-file progress

2. **`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/transcription_tab.py`**
   - Modified `_update_transcription_step()` to pass progress to progress bar
   - Added reset of `current_file_progress` when files complete

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing code continues to work without changes
- Progress bar works correctly even if `update_current_file_progress()` is never called
- Gracefully handles all scenarios (single file, multiple files, no progress info)
