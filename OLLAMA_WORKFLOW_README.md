## 🎬 User Experience Flow

1. **Select "local" provider** → see models with status indicators
2. **Select unavailable model** → system checks service status  
3. **Service not running?** → dialog asks to start it
4. **Model not downloaded?** → dialog shows size and asks permission
5. **Download starts** → progress bar with speed/ETA
6. **When complete** → model ready for immediate use
7. **All future selections** → work instantly
