# ProcessPipelineWorker Crash Prevention - Exhaustive Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Goal**: Prevent ProcessPipelineWorker from crashing the GUI application during long-running batch operations by implementing true process isolation and robust checkpoint recovery.

**Scope**: Transform the highest-risk worker (ProcessPipelineWorker) from QThread to QProcess architecture while maintaining full functionality and adding crash resilience.

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for complete implementation
**Effort**: ~3200 lines of new/modified code
**Risk Level**: Medium (isolated changes, existing checkpoint infrastructure)
