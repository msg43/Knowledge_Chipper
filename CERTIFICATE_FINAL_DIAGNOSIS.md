# Certificate Issue - Final Diagnosis

## The Problem
Despite having what appear to be valid Developer ID certificates:
- Code signing fails with "unable to build chain to self-signed root"
- Apple notarization rejects them as "not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate"

## Most Likely Cause

These certificates appear to be **test/mock Developer ID certificates** that were created for development purposes but are not actual Apple-issued certificates.

### Evidence:
1. **"Self-signed root" error** - Real Apple certificates never produce this error
2. **Apple notarization rejection** - Apple's servers don't recognize them
3. **Certificate creation date** - Sep 21, 2025 (only 4 days ago)
4. **Both .p12 files same size** - 3279 bytes each (unusual for different cert types)

## How to Verify

### Check Apple Developer Portal:
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list
2. Look for these exact certificates:
   - Developer ID Application (created Sep 21, 2025)
   - Developer ID Installer (created Sep 21, 2025)

**If they're NOT listed there, these are not real Apple certificates.**

## The Solution

### Create REAL Apple Developer ID Certificates:

1. **In Xcode** (Easiest):
   - Xcode → Settings → Accounts
   - Select your Apple ID
   - Click "Manage Certificates"
   - Create "Developer ID Application"
   - Create "Developer ID Installer"

2. **On Apple Developer Portal**:
   - https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add
   - Create both certificate types
   - Download and install

3. **Export for Backup**:
   - From Keychain Access
   - Select both certificates + keys
   - Export as .p12

## Why This Happened

Someone likely created test certificates that mimic Developer ID certificates for testing the build process without having to use real certificates. These work locally but fail when submitted to Apple.

## Immediate Action

1. **Check developer.apple.com** - Are these certificates listed?
2. **If not** - Create real certificates through Apple
3. **If yes** - Contact Apple Developer Support with the error details

The certificates you have are structurally valid but not recognized by Apple's infrastructure, which strongly suggests they're test certificates.
