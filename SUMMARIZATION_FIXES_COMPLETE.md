# Summarization Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Transcript Files Not Loading in Summarization Tab
**Symptom:** After successful transcription, clicking "Summarize" in the completion dialog would switch to the summarization tab but show "No transcript files found to load".

**Root Cause:** The `successful_files` list stored only filenames (not full paths), making it impossible to locate the actual transcript files.

**Fix:** Store the full path of saved transcript files in the `successful_files` data structure.

---

### Issue 2: Event Loop Closure During Summarization
**Symptom:** Summarization would fail with `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` errors during async HTTP client cleanup.

**Root Cause:** Async HTTP clients (AsyncOpenAI, AsyncAnthropic) were not properly closed before the event loop shut down, causing cleanup code to run on a closed loop.

**Fix:** Use async context managers (`async with`) to ensure proper client cleanup before event loop closure.

## Detailed Fixes

### Fix 1: Transcript File Path Storage

**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/transcription_tab.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Line ~912**: Added `saved_file_path` field to store full path:
```python
self.successful_files.append({
    "file": file_name,
    "text_length": text_length,
    "saved_to": Path(saved_file).name if saved_file else None,
    "saved_file_path": saved_file,  # NEW: Full path for summarization
})
```

2. **Lines 2484-2533**: Updated file loading logic:
```python
def _switch_to_summarization_with_files(self, successful_files: list[dict], output_dir: str | None):
    for file_info in successful_files:
        # First try full path (new field)
        saved_file_path = file_info.get("saved_file_path")
        if saved_file_path and Path(saved_file_path).exists():
            file_paths.append(str(saved_file_path))
            continue
        
        # Fallback to reconstruction (backward compatibility)
        # ...
```

3. **Line 2484**: Fixed type annotation to allow `None` for `output_dir`.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Transcript files load correctly into summarization tab
- ✅ No more "No transcript files found" warnings
- ✅ Backward compatible with old data structures

### Fix 2: Async Client Cleanup

**File:** `src/knowledge_system/core/llm_adapter.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Lines 373-396**: OpenAI client with context manager:
```python
# OLD
client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key)
response = await client.chat.completions.create(...)

# NEW
async with AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key) as client:
    response = await client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

2. **Lines 428-456**: Anthropic client with context manager:
```python
# OLD
client = AsyncAnthropic(api_key=api_key)
response = await client.messages.create(...)

# NEW
async with AsyncAnthropic(api_key=api_key) as client:
    response = await client.messages.create(...)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more "Event loop is closed" errors
- ✅ Proper cleanup of HTTP connections
- ✅ No resource leaks or orphaned async tasks

## Testing Instructions

### Test Fix 1: Transcript to Summarization Flow
1. Navigate to "Local Transcription" tab
2. Add a test audio/video file
3. Set output directory
4. Click "Start Transcription" and wait for completion
5. When completion dialog appears, click "Continue to Summarization"
6. **Expected Result:** Summarization tab shows transcript files in the file list

### Test Fix 2: Summarization Without Event Loop Errors
1. Load transcript files in summarization tab
2. Select provider and model (OpenAI or Anthropic)
3. Click "Start Summarization"
4. Monitor console logs during summarization
5. **Expected Result:** No "Event loop is closed" errors in logs

## Complete Fix Chain

These fixes build on the earlier event loop fix documented in `ASYNCIO_EVENT_LOOP_FIX.md`:

1. **Previous Fix (ASYNCIO_EVENT_LOOP_FIX.md):**
   - Prevents nested `asyncio.run()` calls
   - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for async code from sync contexts
   - Enables GUI to call async System2 methods

2. **This Fix - Part A (Transcript Paths):**
   - Stores full paths of transcribed files
   - Enables seamless transfer to summarization tab
   - Provides backward compatibility

3. **This Fix - Part B (Client Cleanup):**
   - Ensures async clients close before event loop
   - Prevents cleanup on closed event loops
   - Eliminates resource leaks

Together, these create a robust async execution environment for the GUI.
