# HCE Replacement Progress Report

## Current Status: 22% Complete (15/67 tasks)

### Completed Tasks ✅

#### Environment & Setup (4/4)
- ✅ Created feature branch: `feature/hce-replacement`
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with HCE dependencies
- ✅ Created comprehensive backup via git commit
- ✅ Created rollback strategy document

#### Database Tasks (5/5)
- ✅ Added processing_type column to summaries table
- ✅ Added hce_data_json column to summaries table
- ✅ Created data migration script for existing records
- ✅ Added FTS5 indexes for claim search (already in HCE schema)
- ✅ Tested migration on sample database

#### Processing Tasks (1/2)
- ✅ Added database persistence for HCE data
- ⏳ Implement caching layer for embeddings

#### GUI Tasks (1/5)
- ✅ Created gui/adapters/hce_adapter.py
- ⏳ Update ProcessPipelineWorker to use HCE
- ⏳ Update EnhancedSummarizationWorker
- ⏳ Update MOCGenerationWorker
- ⏳ Add progress tracking for HCE stages

#### Command Tasks (1/5)
- ✅ Updated commands/summarize.py to save HCE data
- ⏳ Update commands/moc.py entity extraction
- ⏳ Update commands/process.py options
- ⏳ Remove legacy summarization style options
- ⏳ Add HCE-specific CLI options

### Remaining Major Work Areas

1. **File Generation (0/5)** - Update FileGenerationService for HCE outputs
2. **Configuration (0/5)** - Remove legacy settings, add HCE configurations
3. **UI Updates (0/12)** - Update tabs, add claim filtering, remove old options
4. **Advanced Features (0/10)** - Search, batch processing, visualization
5. **Migration Tools (0/5)** - Convert existing data to HCE format
6. **Cleanup (0/5)** - Remove legacy code and tests
7. **Testing & Deployment (0/4)** - Performance tests, deployment plan

## Key Achievements

1. **Database Ready**: Full HCE schema with backward compatibility views
2. **Core Processors**: HCE-based SummarizerProcessor and MOCProcessor working
3. **Persistence**: Database can store claims, entities, and relations
4. **GUI Adapter**: Created adapter pattern for seamless integration
5. **Tests**: Basic HCE tests and migration tests passing

## Next Priority Tasks

1. Update GUI workers to use HCE processors
2. Update FileGenerationService for claims reports
3. Add HCE configuration settings
4. Update UI tabs to show claim information
5. Create migration tool for existing summaries

## Blockers & Issues

None currently - implementation proceeding smoothly.

## Time Estimate

At current pace (~15 tasks in 2 hours), estimated completion:
- Remaining tasks: 52
- Estimated time: ~7-8 hours
- Can be accelerated by focusing on critical path items

## Recommendation

Focus on critical path items that enable end-to-end functionality:
1. GUI worker updates (enables UI testing)
2. File generation (enables output verification)
3. Basic UI updates (enables user testing)

Advanced features and cleanup can be deferred to a second phase.
