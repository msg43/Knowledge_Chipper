## 📊 Optimal Configuration (M2 Ultra 128GB)

### **Recommended: 6 Accounts**

**Why 6 instead of 3**:
```
Your M2 Ultra 128GB can run:
  - 20 parallel processing workers
  - Processing capacity: 1,200 videos/day

With 3 accounts:
  - Download rate: 756 videos/day
  - Workers idle 37% of time
  - Timeline: 9 days

With 6 accounts: ⚡
  - Download rate: 1,512 videos/day
  - Workers at 95% utilization (optimal!)
  - Timeline: 6 days ✅
  
Improvement: 33% faster for only 1 hour extra setup
```

## 🚀 How to Use (Complete Guide)

### Phase 1: Setup (2 hours)

**Create 6 Throwaway Accounts** (1 hour)
```
Create Gmail accounts:
  throwaway.yt.downloads.1@gmail.com
  throwaway.yt.downloads.2@gmail.com
  throwaway.yt.downloads.3@gmail.com
  throwaway.yt.downloads.4@gmail.com
  throwaway.yt.downloads.5@gmail.com
  throwaway.yt.downloads.6@gmail.com

For each:
1. Create account (fake name OK)
2. Mark as 18+
3. Log in to YouTube
4. Watch 2-3 random videos
5. Let sit 24 hours (optional)
```

**Export Cookies** (30 min)
```
For each account:
1. Install browser extension: "Get cookies.txt"
2. Log in to YouTube with that account
3. Click extension → Export cookies
4. Save as: cookies_account_1.txt, cookies_account_2.txt, etc.
5. Place in project directory
```

**Get Your Video URLs** (10 min)
```bash
# Option A: Export playlists with yt-dlp
yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print url "YOUR_PLAYLIST_URL" > urls.txt

# Option B: Use YouTube Data API
# Option C: Manual copy from browser

# These are URLs from YOUR account
# Throwaway accounts just provide authentication
```

### Phase 2: Configure GUI (10 min)

```
1. Launch Knowledge Chipper
2. Go to Transcription tab
3. Scroll to "Cookie Authentication (Multi-Account Support)"
4. Check "Enable multi-account cookie authentication"
5. Click "➕ Add Another Account" until you have 6 slots
6. For each slot:
   - Click "Browse..."
   - Select cookies_account_N.txt
7. Click "🧪 Test All Cookies"
   Expected output:
     ✅ Account 1: Valid (127 cookies)
     ✅ Account 2: Valid (131 cookies)
     ✅ Account 3: Valid (125 cookies)
     ✅ Account 4: Valid (129 cookies)
     ✅ Account 5: Valid (133 cookies)
     ✅ Account 6: Valid (128 cookies)
     ✅ 6 valid accounts | Total: 6 accounts

8. Paste your 7000 URLs (or load from file)
9. Click "Start"
```

### Phase 3: Monitor Progress (~6 days)

**Day 1 (06:00)**:
```
🚀 Using 6 accounts for downloads
   Expected speedup: 6x faster than single account
   Expected timeline: ~6 days

🔍 Checking 7000 URLs for duplicates...
✅ Found 4,237 unique videos (2,763 duplicates skipped)

Downloads starting with account rotation...
✅ Downloaded via account 1/6 (1/4237)
✅ Downloaded via account 2/6 (2/4237)
✅ Downloaded via account 3/6 (3/4237)
✅ Downloaded via account 4/6 (4/4237)
✅ Downloaded via account 5/6 (5/4237)
✅ Downloaded via account 6/6 (6/4237)
...
```

**Each Night (00:00-06:00)**:
```
😴 Entering sleep period at 2025-10-28 00:00 PST
   All 6 accounts paused. Processing continues.
   Will resume in 6.0 hours at 2025-10-28 06:00 PST
```

**Each Morning (06:00)**:
```
☀️ Sleep period ended, resuming downloads
```

**Day 6 (Final)**:
```
📊 Final Statistics:
   Total URLs: 7,000
   Unique videos: 4,237
   Successfully downloaded: 4,235 (99.95%)
   Failed: 2 (0.05%)
   Duplicates skipped: 2,763 (39.5%)
   
   Accounts status:
     Account 1: Active (710 downloads)
     Account 2: Active (705 downloads)
     Account 3: Active (708 downloads)
     Account 4: Active (712 downloads)
     Account 5: Active (700 downloads)
     Account 6: Disabled (stale cookies after 650 downloads)
   
   Time saved by deduplication: ~46 hours
   Time saved by multi-account: ~22 days vs single account
   
✅ Batch processing complete!
```

## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Timeline Comparison for 7000 Videos

| Strategy | Accounts | Timeline | Speedup | Worker Util |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Sequential | 1 (no parallelization) | 121 days | 1x | 4% |
| Optimized Single | 1 (20 workers) | 28 days | 4.3x | 28% |
| Multi-Account | 3 (20 workers) | 9 days | 13.4x | 63% |
| **Optimal** | **6 (20 workers)** | **6 days** | **20x** | **95%** ✅ |

**Recommended**: 6 accounts for M2 Ultra 128GB

### Bottleneck Analysis

| Accounts | Download Rate | Processing Rate | Bottleneck | Wasted Capacity |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 252/day | 1,200/day | Downloads | 79% |
| 3 | 756/day | 1,200/day | Downloads | 37% |
| **6** | **1,512/day** | **1,200/day** | **Processing** | **5%** ✅ |

With 6 accounts, you **finally hit the processing bottleneck**, meaning you're using your hardware optimally!

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Downloads Are Fast (Corrected Understanding)
- Audio-only download: ~15 seconds per 60-min video (60 MB)
- Cookie delay: 3-5 minutes (bot prevention)
- **Total per video**: 4.5 minutes
- **Not the bottleneck** with proper parallelization ✅

### 2. Local LLM Processing Is Slow (The Real Bottleneck)
- Transcription: 5-10 minutes
- Mining: 8-12 minutes (with 8 parallel segments)
- Evaluation: 2-5 minutes
- **Total per video**: ~20 minutes
- **40x slower than downloads** 🐌

### 3. Parallelization Closes the Gap
- Single account, sequential: 121 days
- 6 accounts, 20 workers: **6 days** ✅
- **20x speedup** through intelligent parallelization

### 4. Cookie Delays Don't Matter
- Downloads take 4.5 min including delay
- Processing takes 20 min
- Downloads naturally stay ahead
- **No complex queue management needed** ✅

### 5. Same IP is Safer
- No IP hopping (looks less bot-like)
- Mimics YouTube Premium family (6 accounts, same IP)
- Each account maintains safe individual patterns
- **Lower risk than using proxies** ✅
