# Knowledge Chipper (Skip the Podcast Desktop)

> Transform audio, video, and documents into structured knowledge with AI-powered analysis

**Version 3.2.22** | **macOS Application** | **Offline-First Design**

## Why Knowledge Chipper Exists

In our information-rich world, valuable insights are buried in hours of podcasts, video lectures, research papers, and meeting recordings. Knowledge Chipper was created to solve a fundamental problem: **extracting actionable intelligence from unstructured media content**.

Traditional transcription tools give you text. Knowledge Chipper gives you **structured knowledge**:
- **Claims** with confidence ratings (A/B/C tiers)
- **Speaker identification** with 97% voice fingerprinting accuracy  
- **Entity extraction** (people, concepts, technical terms)
- **Relationship mapping** between ideas and contradictions
- **Evidence citations** linking claims to exact sources

Perfect for researchers, students, professionals, and anyone who needs to process large volumes of content efficiently.
