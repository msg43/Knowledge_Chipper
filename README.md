4. In the app, enable cookie authentication and upload your cookie file
5. Configure rate limiting (3-5 minute delays recommended)

**Why Use Cookies?**
- More reliable downloads for large batches
- Reduces rate limiting issues
- Designed for processing 100+ videos
- Cookies stay local - never shared with anyone

**Security:**
- Browser extraction disabled to prevent using your main account
- Only manual cookie file upload supported
- Use a throwaway account exclusively for bulk downloads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Installation Warnings:**
- macOS may show a security warning on first launch
- Right-click the app ‚Üí Open to bypass Gatekeeper

**Processing Stuck or Slow:**
- Check that Ollama is running (if using local models)
- Larger files take longer - a 1-hour video may take 10-15 minutes
- Check available disk space - processing creates temporary files

**Speaker Identification Issues:**
- If speakers aren't being identified correctly, manually assign names
- The app learns from your corrections and improves over time
- Enable speaker diarization in settings if it's disabled

**API Errors:**
- Verify your API keys in the Settings tab
- Check that the selected model is available
- For local models, ensure Ollama is running and the model is downloaded
