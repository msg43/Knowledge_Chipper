## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. SQLAlchemy Type Warnings
**Issue:** Pyright shows type errors for SQLAlchemy Column assignments  
**Impact:** None (false positives, runtime works correctly)  
**Status:** Can be ignored

### 2. Flagship Evaluation Simplified
**Issue:** Currently marks all claims as tier B  
**Impact:** No filtering by quality yet  
**Workaround:** Full evaluation can be added later  
**Status:** By design for MVP

### 3. Transcription Placeholder
**Issue:** Assumes transcript already exists  
**Impact:** No audio→text conversion yet  
**Workaround:** Use existing transcripts  
**Status:** By design for MVP

### 4. Upload Not Implemented
**Issue:** _process_upload() is stub  
**Impact:** No cloud upload yet  
**Workaround:** Add when needed  
**Status:** Out of scope for Phase 1

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

### Phase 4 → Phase 3
Revert `summarization_tab.py` changes (2 lines)

### Phase 3 → Phase 2
Orchestrator returns placeholder responses (original state)

### Phase 2 → Phase 1
Delete `hce_operations.py` (no dependencies)

### Phase 1 → Original
Revert `llm_adapter.py` to mock implementation

**All phases are independently reversible**
