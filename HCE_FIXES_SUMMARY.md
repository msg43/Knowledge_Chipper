# HCE Schema Validation and Foreign Key Fixes - Summary

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Schema Validation Error on Rejected Claims
**Symptom:**
```
WARNING | Flagship evaluation failed: Schema validation failed for flagship_output: 
'rank' is a required property
```

**Root Cause:** The flagship schema required `rank` field for ALL claims, including rejected ones.

**Fix:** 
- Removed `rank` from required fields in `flagship_output.v1.json`
- Added automatic repair logic to add placeholder rank (999) for missing ranks
- Rejected claims no longer fail validation

### 2. Foreign Key Constraint on Segments Table
**Symptom:**
```
ERROR | Database storage failed: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) FOREIGN KEY constraint failed
[SQL: INSERT INTO segments ...]
```

**Root Cause:** Segments were being inserted before the episode record existed.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced `ClaimStore.store_segments()` to check if episode exists
- Automatically creates minimal episode + source records if needed
- Segments can now be stored safely before full pipeline processing

## Files Modified

1. **schemas/flagship_output.v1.json** - Removed rank from required fields
2. **src/knowledge_system/processors/hce/schema_validator.py** - Added rank repair logic
3. **src/knowledge_system/database/claim_store.py** - Added episode pre-creation
4. **src/knowledge_system/core/system2_orchestrator_mining.py** - Updated store_segments call
5. **MANIFEST.md** - Documented changes

## Verification

Run the test script:
```bash
python3 scripts/test_hce_fixes.py
```

All tests pass ✅:
- ✓ Schema no longer requires rank for rejected claims
- ✓ Validator automatically repairs missing rank fields
- ✓ ClaimStore creates episode record before storing segments
- ✓ Foreign key constraints are properly handled
- ✓ System2Orchestrator passes necessary parameters

## Impact

**Before:**
- Pipeline failed on rejected claims due to missing rank field
- Segments couldn't be stored if episode didn't exist yet
- Foreign key constraint violations crashed the mining process

**After:**
- Rejected claims pass validation (rank is optional)
- Missing ranks are automatically repaired with placeholder value (999)
- Episodes are automatically created before storing segments
- Foreign key constraints are always satisfied
- Pipeline is more robust and fault-tolerant
