# Bandit configuration for Knowledge Chipper
# Skip specific tests for legitimate system operations

# B404: subprocess import - Required for legitimate system operations
# B603: subprocess without shell=True - Our calls use lists, which is safer
# B607: partial executable paths - We use system commands like 'open' and 'osascript'
# B110: try/except/pass - Often legitimate for error handling
# B101: assert statements - Used in examples and tests
# B311: random usage - Used for non-cryptographic purposes (delays, etc.)
# B112: try/except/continue - Often legitimate for error handling
# B108: hardcoded temp directory - Test code using /tmp for mock files
# B310: URL open - Legitimate file downloads and API calls
# B103: file permissions - Setting executable permissions for scripts
# B306: mktemp - Legacy code for temp file creation
# B113: requests without timeout - Some legitimate cases
# B608: SQL expressions - Using parameterized queries safely
