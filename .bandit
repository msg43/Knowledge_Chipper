# Bandit configuration for Knowledge Chipper
# Skip specific tests for legitimate system operations

# B404: subprocess import - Required for legitimate system operations

# B607: partial executable paths - We use system commands like 'open' and 'osascript'
# B110: try/except/pass - Often legitimate for error handling
# B101: assert statements - Used in examples and tests
