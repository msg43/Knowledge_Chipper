# ✅ Certificates Working! Now Set Up Notarization

Your certificates are properly installed and working. The test package was created successfully.

## What You Need:

1. **Apple ID**: Your developer account email
2. **Team ID**: Your 10-character team ID (e.g., W2AT7M9482)
3. **App-Specific Password**: Create at https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage

## Quick Setup:

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)
Run this and follow the prompts:
```bash
./scripts/setup_notarization_credentials.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
Store credentials in keychain:
```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "Skip-the-Podcast-Notary" \
  --apple-id "your@email.com" \
  --team-id "W2AT7M9482" \
  --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

## Your Team ID
Based on your certificates, your Team ID is: **W2AT7M9482**

## After Setup:

Test notarization with the debug script:
```bash
./scripts/build_signed_notarized_pkg_debug.sh
```

Or build your actual app:
```bash
./scripts/build_signed_notarized_pkg.sh
```

## Success Indicators:
- ✅ Certificates installed and trusted
- ✅ Private keys properly linked
- ✅ Test package created successfully
- ⏳ Just need to add notarization credentials

The certificate warnings you see are cosmetic and won't affect notarization!
