**[00:09 - 00:34]** Good afternoon. We are going on a video record at 1.47 pm. Today's date is September 5th, 2019. This begins media unit one in a video recorded deposition of Maxine Wolf, taken on behalf of the plaintiffs. In a case matter of 30 dole, at all versus Wolf development, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

**[00:34 - 01:04]** This deposition is being held at the law offices of Hallowell and Phillips, located in Hamilton, New Jersey. My name is Kevin Duncan, and I am a certified legal video specialist from the firm of Veritex Legal Solutions. The Corp. today is Ms. Teresa Lazaro from the firm of Veritex Legal Solutions. Will the Corp. please administer the oath. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you're about to give will be the truth the whole truth and not be about the truth. Yes.

**[01:04 - 01:34]** You may proceed. Good afternoon. My name is Alexandra Sokolov, and I represent the Cerdudo family in this case. Before we get started, I just want to go through the ground rules of deposition to make sure that we're on the same page. Could you please state your full name for the record? Maxine Schlecht Wolf. And you understand that you are under oath, and that being under oath means you are sworn to tell the truth. Yes.

**[01:34 - 01:45]** Have you ever had your deposition taken in the past? No. You understand that your responses here have the same force as they would in a courtroom with a judge in a jury? I do.

**[01:48 - 02:15]** Is there any reason such as being under unusual stress, mental or physical condition or being under the influence of any substances that would prevent or limit you today from giving truthful answers to my questions? No. There is nothing wrong with asking me to repeat a question or explain a term if you don't understand my question. However, if you answer my question, I'm going to assume that you understood it. Do you understand this? Yes, I understand.

**[02:15 - 02:43]** And if you need to take a break at any time, just tell me and we can take a break. Is that okay? That's fine. Before your deposition, did you review any documents in preparation? No. Okay. What is your date of birth? October 13, 1978. Where were you born? Ulrich, New Jersey. And what is your current address?

**[02:44 - 03:13]** 588 Randolph in Hammington, New Jersey. And how long have you lived there? Eight years. Have you ever been arrested? No. Have you ever been convicted of a crime? No. Have you ever been involved in any other legal claims or lawsuits? No. And what is your current occupation? I'm the president and CEO of Wolf Development Inc.

**[03:15 - 03:36]** When did you begin employment with wolf development? When I founded it. Do you remember what year you founded it? Somewhere around 2008. And when you first became associated with wolf development, what capacity was it in? I founded it. It's my company.

**[03:37 - 04:05]** And what type of work does Wolf development do? Can you give me examples of the type of projects you're involved in? Sure. We specialize in acquiring underused properties, I would say, that aren't maximizing their potential. We turn them into something that is more appealing, interesting for the community. You might say we pave paradise and put up a different type of paradise.

**[04:06 - 04:32]** Are you acquainted with the Cerdido siblings, Bruce Mallory and Cassidy Cerdido, who reside in the Campbell-Walton corridor? Somewhat acquainted, yes. What is your relationship with the Cerdido family? I attempted to work with them to acquire their property for a new development. Have you worked with them before this? No. And how did you attempt to contact them?

**[04:33 - 05:01]** I reached out via email to make a generous offer on properties they were not maximizing. And how did you obtain the Sardido's email addresses? They were from a promotional marketing database we had completely legal access to. Did you ever meet them in person? No, I don't believe I did. So you've never been to their homes? I did. I stopped by, but no one answered the door.

**[05:02 - 05:30]** I'd like to enter Exhibit 1 into Evidence, Bates Number TLP0011. This is an email conversation between Ms. Wolf and Brutus Serdido that took place on March 14th and March 15th, 2006. Ms. Wolf, here's a copy of the email. Do you recognize it? Yes.

**[05:31 - 05:57]** Ms. Wolf, can you please read the top paragraph on the page starting? I have some friends in the building inspector's office for me. I have some friends in the building inspector's office that would be very interested in how you've constructed this home with shoddy materials and no permits. And it would be a shame if it got blown down in the storm that's being forecast for overnight tonight.

**[05:58 - 06:26]** And what was your intent in writing that email? I wanted to make sure that Mr. Sardito was aware of the dire circumstances he placed himself in by failing to keep his house up. Were you threatening Mr. Sardito with consequences if he didn't sell his property to you? Absolutely not. If he felt threatened, it's his own fault for not keeping up his house. What is your opinion of people who live in substandard housing conditions?

**[06:28 - 06:58]** Some say that the standard you live in reflects the standard of your life. And you took special pleasure in trying to remove the serdedo siblings from their homes. Isn't that right Mrs. Wolf? I wouldn't say that exactly no. You think they don't deserve to live there, isn't that correct? Objection, harassment. Okay, I'll move on. Miss Wolf, what made you so interested in acquiring the three properties at 915, 917, and 919 Campbell?

**[06:58 - 07:21]** It's my job. It's my passion. I guess I'm always on the hunt for something new to develop. But you had a special interest in acquiring these three properties, isn't that right? Yes, they're very appealing and in a great location. Did you have any plans for these properties? My mind is always filled with plans for properties.

**[07:23 - 07:42]** Miss Wolve, are you aware of the proposal for a new barbecue restaurant on the properties owned by the Sardido siblings? Oh, yes. Yeah, I've heard rumblings of this. But did you have specific plans to participate in the development of the barbecue restaurant? I wouldn't say I had specific plans, but all ideas are on the table, sure.

**[07:43 - 08:11]** I'd like to enter exhibit two into evidence. Bates number TLP0015. This is a series of emails between Ms. Wolfe and two colleagues at Wolf Development, Hunter Reckwin and 10th, 10th Drake. Ms. Wolfe, what is your relationship with Mr. Reckwin? Hunter's been my vice president of property management for the past five years. And what is your relationship with Ms. Drake?

**[08:12 - 08:40]** She is our manager for investments and acquisitions. Ms. Wolf, do you recognize these emails? I do. Would you please read the initial email from March 12, 2016? You'll find that on page two of this printout. I may have identified a prime location to build our barbecue joint.

**[08:41 - 09:03]** When you can, go drive by 915 and 917 Campbell. The current structures are sorely in need of big repairs, so it would be much easier to buy them out and redevelop them. So based on this email, it sounds like you were highly motivated to build the BBQ restaurant on these properties. Isn't that true? I guess you could say that.

**[09:04 - 09:32]** Ms. Woolf, are you aware that the two properties belonging to Mallory and Brutus or Dito at 915 and 917 Campbell were both destroyed soon after you reached out with an offer to purchase them? I do remember there were terrible storms that night. It was so awful. I lost all my rose bushes. It was terrible. Are the storms you're referencing the storms of March 15th and March 16th, 2016? I... Sure, that sounds right.

**[09:33 - 09:55]** And were you in Hammington on either of those nights in 2016? I believe so, yes, but I likely slept through the storms. You say you slept through the storms on both of the nights? Like a baby, yes. And during what hours of the evening were you asleep? Most likely 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. early to bed early to rise, that's me.

**[09:55 - 10:17]** So you were in your home when the storms came through Hammington in the late evening of both March 15th and March 16th. Objection, ask an answer. Okay. Moving on, Miss Wolfe, were you actively involved in the destruction of properties at 915 and 917 Campbell? Absolutely not. It was an act of nature.

**[10:18 - 10:47]** I'd like to enter exhibit three into evidence. Bates number TLP0017. This is a sales receipt from a company named Fans Are Us. Miss Wolfe, I'm gonna hand you a copy of this receipt. Can you please read me the description of what was purchased? This is for a super industrial grade wind machine. And can you please tell me who was listed as a purchaser under sold too? Wolf Development Inc.

**[10:48 - 11:02]** Thank you, and can you please read the date for me? March 15th, 2016. Ms. Wolf, did you purchase this win machine on March 15th, 2016? Of course I did. And what was the reason you purchased such a device?

**[11:02 - 11:28]** You might be aware my company has been finishing up work over the last several years. Lots of current projects simultaneously going on. We were having trouble with the paint that we purchased seemed to not want to dry because of the humidity. I was trying to speed things up with this machine. So the purpose of this industrial grade wind machine was to dry paint. I don't know if it's this expressed purpose, but I was willing to try anything, okay?

**[11:29 - 11:58]** Ms. Wolf, are you aware that the machine of this size could easily be used to destroy a home built out of substance and materials? Materials like recycled hay or industrial compressed wood shavings. I suppose anything is possible. And do you think it's possible that a machine like this could have been used to destroy the homes of Mallory and Brutus or Dito? This machine was used for drying paint. I thought we already established that the storms are what caused the two homes to blow over.

**[11:59 - 12:17]** I'd like to return to exhibit two again. The email conversation between you and your colleague, Mr. Requan and Ms. Drake. Ms. Wolf, can you please take a look again at that printout and read the first paragraph of the email you sent to your colleague on March 17th, 2016, starting with the words, our luck.

**[12:17 - 12:46]** Our luck has been unbelievable. Last night's second unnatural wind storm has blown down the wooden house at 917. We must work now to secure for the 919 lot. Our barbecue joint will be the quintessential hipster hangout once we get the full patio in place. Ms. Wolf, what did you mean when you used the word unnatural to describe the storm? It was just a really strong storm, nothing more than that.

**[12:47 - 13:16]** and your email, you mentioned your unbelievable luck to your colleagues despite the tragic destruction that occurred to the Sarditos. Do you think it's quite a coincidence that the homes were blown down on the two properties you were trying to acquire and that this happened within less than 48 hours of your purchase of a super industrial grade wind machine that was capable of causing that exact kind of damage? All I know is I had a lot of wet paint to dry. And as for my luck, I've always been lucky.

**[13:17 - 13:41]** Okay, Ms. Wolf, I'm going to ask you directly. Did you or anyone on your behalf use an industrial strength wind machine to cause destruction to the homes of Mallory and Brutus Sardito? No, absolutely not. Those homes were in such bad shape that all anyone had to do is walk by huff and puff and they would blow them right in. Okay, I think I have all my answers. No further questions.

**[13:44 - 13:54]** We are going off to video record at 2 o'clock p.m. and concludes today's testimony. Give it by Ms. Maxine Wolf. Master Media will be retained by favorite text legal solutions. Thank you all. Have a good day.
