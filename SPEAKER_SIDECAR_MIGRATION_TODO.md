# Speaker Sidecar File Migration to SQLite - COMPLETED ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED on 2025-08-31
**Migration Version**: v3.1.2
**All TODOs Successfully Implemented**

## Overview
This document outlines the complete migration from `.speaker_assignments.json` sidecar files to a pure SQLite-based speaker attribution system. The goal is to eliminate file-based storage redundancy while preserving all functionality and improving the speaker attribution workflow.

## Current State Analysis

### Data Currently in Sidecar Files
Based on the codebase analysis, sidecar files contain:
```json
{
  "transcript": "/path/to/transcript.json",
  "assignments": {"SPEAKER_00": "Joe Rogan", "SPEAKER_01": "Jordan Peterson"},
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:25.123456",
  "user_confirmed": false,
  "segments": [
    {
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 5.2,
      "speaker_id": "SPEAKER_00",
      "assigned_name": "Joe Rogan",
      "text": "Sample text snippet..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Current Database Schema Gaps
The existing `speaker_assignments` table has:
- ✅ `recording_path`, `speaker_id`, `assigned_name`, `confidence`, `user_confirmed`, `created_at`
- ❌ Missing: Sample segments for quick preview
- ❌ Missing: AI suggested names and confidence scores
- ❌ Missing: Processing metadata (source method, etc.)

## Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancements

### 1.1 Extend SpeakerAssignment Table
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/database/speaker_models.py`

**Add new columns to `SpeakerAssignment` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN suggested_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN suggestion_confidence FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN suggestion_method VARCHAR(100);  -- 'content_analysis', 'pattern_matching', 'manual'
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN sample_segments_json TEXT;  -- JSON array of first 5 segments
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN total_duration FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN segment_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN processing_metadata_json TEXT;  -- Additional metadata
ALTER TABLE speaker_assignments ADD COLUMN updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create database migration script: `src/knowledge_system/database/migrations/003_speaker_assignment_enhancements.py`
- [ ] Update `SpeakerAssignment` SQLAlchemy model with new columns
- [ ] Update `SpeakerAssignmentModel` Pydantic model with new fields
- [ ] Add database upgrade/downgrade logic
- [ ] Test migration with existing database

### 1.2 Create Speaker Processing Session Table
**Purpose:** Track batch processing sessions and learning data

```sql
CREATE TABLE speaker_processing_sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    recording_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    processing_method VARCHAR(100),  -- 'diarization', 'manual', 'imported'
    total_speakers INTEGER,
    total_duration FLOAT,
    ai_suggestions_json TEXT,  -- All AI suggestions before user input
    user_corrections_json TEXT,  -- What user changed from AI suggestions
    confidence_scores_json TEXT,  -- Confidence in each assignment
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (recording_path) REFERENCES speaker_assignments(recording_path)
);
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `SpeakerProcessingSession` SQLAlchemy model
- [ ] Create `SpeakerProcessingSessionModel` Pydantic model  
- [ ] Add CRUD methods to `SpeakerDatabaseService`
- [ ] Add migration script for new table

## Phase 2: Data Collection and Storage Updates

### 2.1 Update SpeakerProcessor to Collect All Data
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/processors/speaker_processor.py`

**Current gaps:**
- `sample_texts` and `first_five_segments` are computed but not stored in database
- AI suggestions are generated but not persisted for learning
- Pattern matching results are not saved for improvement

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify `prepare_speaker_data()` to return enhanced `SpeakerData` with all metadata
- [ ] Update `_suggest_speaker_name()` to return detailed suggestion metadata (method used, confidence breakdown)
- [ ] Create `_prepare_database_assignment()` method to format data for database storage
- [ ] Add `save_speaker_processing_session()` method to capture full session data
- [ ] Update `apply_speaker_assignments()` to store sample segments and metadata

**Enhanced SpeakerData structure needed:**
```python
class SpeakerData(BaseModel):
    speaker_id: str
    segments: List[SpeakerSegment]
    total_duration: float
    segment_count: int
    sample_texts: List[str]
    first_five_segments: List[Dict]
    suggested_name: Optional[str]
    confidence_score: float
    suggestion_method: str  # NEW
    suggestion_metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # NEW - detailed analysis
    pattern_matches: List[Dict]  # NEW - what patterns were found
```

### 2.2 Update AudioProcessor Speaker Assignment Flow
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/processors/audio_processor.py`

**Current issues:**
- `_handle_speaker_assignment()` saves to database but misses learning data
- No capture of AI suggestions before user modifications

- [ ] Add session metadata (diarization quality, audio duration, etc.)

### 2.3 Update Speaker Intelligence Learning Storage
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/utils/speaker_intelligence.py`

**Current gaps:**
- Pattern matching results not systematically stored
- Content analysis insights not captured for learning
- User corrections not fed back into pattern improvement

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify `extract_podcast_speakers()` to save detailed analysis results

- [ ] **UPDATE:** `_save_confirmation()` to only use database, remove sidecar writing
- [ ] **UPDATE:** `load_transcript_from_path()` to load assignments from database via `recording_path`
- [ ] **ADD:** Database queries for finding unconfirmed transcripts
- [ ] **ADD:** Sample segment display from database JSON field
- [ ] **UPDATE:** Preview functionality to use database-stored segments

**New database query methods needed:**
```python
def get_unconfirmed_recordings(self) -> List[str]:
    """Get list of recording paths with unconfirmed speaker assignments."""
    
def get_recordings_needing_review(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """Get recordings with AI suggestions but no user confirmation."""
    
def get_speaker_assignment_summary(self, recording_path: str) -> Dict:
    """Get complete assignment summary with samples for a recording."""
```

### 3.2 Update Speaker Assignment Dialog
**File:** `src/knowledge_system/gui/dialogs/speaker_assignment_dialog.py`
