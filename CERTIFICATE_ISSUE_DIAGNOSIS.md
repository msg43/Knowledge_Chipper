# Certificate Issue Diagnosis

## The Problem
Your certificates are being rejected with the error:
- **"unable to build chain to self-signed root"**
- **"The binary is not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate"**

## Root Cause Analysis

### The "Self-Signed Root" Error Means:
1. The certificate chain leads to a **self-signed certificate** instead of Apple's official root CA
2. This typically happens when:
   - Test/development certificates are used instead of production certificates
   - Certificates were created outside of Apple's official process
   - The certificate was generated locally for testing

### Key Evidence:
1. **Certificate dates**: Created Sep 21, 2025 (future date - is your system date correct?)
2. **Chain error**: "unable to build chain to self-signed root"
3. **Notarization rejection**: Apple doesn't recognize them as valid Developer ID certificates

## Most Likely Scenario

These certificates appear to be **test certificates** or were created through an unofficial process:
- They have "Developer ID" in the name but aren't actual Apple Developer ID certificates
- They're self-signed or signed by a non-Apple authority
- Apple's notarization service correctly rejects them

## How to Verify

### Check on Apple Developer Portal:
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list
2. Look for your Developer ID certificates
3. They should show:
   - **Created by**: Apple
   - **Status**: Valid
   - **Type**: Developer ID Application / Developer ID Installer

### If They're NOT Listed:
These are not real Apple Developer ID certificates.

## Solution

### You Need REAL Apple Developer ID Certificates:

1. **Log into Apple Developer**:
   - https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add

2. **Create New Certificates**:
   - Click "+" to create new certificate
   - Choose "Developer ID Application"
   - Follow Apple's CSR process
   - Download the .cer file
   - Repeat for "Developer ID Installer"

3. **Critical**: The CSR (Certificate Signing Request) must be created on the Mac where you'll use the certificates

4. **Export Properly**:
   - After installing, export from Keychain with private keys
   - Save as .p12 with password

## Quick Test

If these are real Apple certificates, this command should work:
```bash
security find-certificate -c "Developer ID Application" -p | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep "Apple Inc"
```

Real Apple certificates will show Apple Inc. in multiple places in the certificate chain.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify on developer.apple.com** - Are these certificates listed there?
2. **If not listed** - Create new ones through Apple's official process
3. **If listed** - Contact Apple Developer Support for help

The "self-signed root" error is definitive - these certificates were not created through Apple's official Developer ID program.
