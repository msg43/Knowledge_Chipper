    The Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program has fundamentally altered the relationship between monetary policy and asset prices.
    According to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, this creates what economists call a 'wealth effect' where rising asset prices boost consumer spending.

    However, some critics argue this approach primarily benefits wealthy asset holders rather than the broader economy.
    The concept of 'trickle-down economics' suggests that benefits to the wealthy eventually reach lower-income groups, but empirical evidence for this mechanism remains contested.

    Modern monetary theory (MMT) proposes an alternative framework where government spending is constrained by inflation rather than fiscal deficits.
    This represents a paradigm shift from traditional Keynesian economics.
