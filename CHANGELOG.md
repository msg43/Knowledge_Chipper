### 🧠 Context-Driven Long‑Form Analysis (New Synthesis Engine)
- **Purpose**: Deliver faithful, scalable analysis for very long inputs (multi‑hour transcripts, large PDFs) without dumping entire texts into a single prompt.
- **How it works (high level)**:
  - **Adaptive segmentation** guided by content signals keeps attention dense where it matters.
  - **Retrieval‑first synthesis**: works from targeted slices, not the whole transcript at once.
  - **Structured extraction**: schema‑validated outputs for entities, concepts, relationships, and claims.
  - **Evidence tracking**: quotes include character spans and paragraph indices; configurable quote caps.
  - **Linking & deduplication**: conservative cross‑references across chunks/files (allows "none" when uncertain).
  - **Verification pass**: checks top claims and surfaces contradictions before finalizing results.
  - **Preflight token budgeting**: respects real model windows and prompt/output budgets.
  - **Refine loop**: if quality gates fail, re‑reads only targeted regions, not the whole corpus.
  - **Artifacts for reproducibility**: final outputs plus optional scorecards, decision logs, link graphs, token traces, and lightweight ledgers.
- **Why we added this**: To maximize accuracy, transparency, and cost efficiency on long content while keeping normal GUI/CLI flows simple. Advanced behavior stays mostly invisible by default; power users can review artifacts when needed.

#### How It Works:
1. **Header Detection**: Automatically identifies key H3 sections in documents
2. **Content Extraction**: Pulls content from each identified section
3. **YAML Mapping**: Converts headers to structured YAML fields (spaces → underscores)
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Creates logical sections if no H3 headers are found

#### Example Transformation:
```markdown
### Executive Summary
This document analyzes market trends...

### Key Findings  
The research reveals three main insights...

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend...
```

Becomes:
```yaml
Executive_Summary: |
  This document analyzes market trends...
Key_Findings: |
  The research reveals three main insights...
Recommendations: |
  Based on the analysis, we recommend...
Is_MOC: false
```

### Apple Silicon Optimization

Skip the Podcast Desktop is heavily optimized for Apple Silicon, providing significant performance improvements over Intel Macs:

#### MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) Integration

**🎯 Why MPS Over CoreML:**

For the Knowledge System's use case (large-scale content processing), MPS provides superior performance:

**🚀 MPS Advantages:**
- **Large Memory Support**: Handles files 60+ minutes without memory constraints
- **Batch Processing**: Excels at processing multiple files simultaneously
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports any Whisper model size without conversion
- **Consistent Performance**: Predictable scaling across different content types
- **Future-Proof**: Scales with GPU improvements in new Apple Silicon chips

**📊 Performance Comparison (Apple M2 Pro, 32GB):**

| Workload Type | CoreML | MPS | Performance Gain |
|---------------|--------|-----|------------------|
| Single 30min file | 8 min | 6 min | 25% faster |
| Single 90min file | 28 min | 15 min | 87% faster |
| Batch 5x 60min | Memory Error | 45 min | MPS only |
| Large model (large-v3) | Not supported | 20 min | MPS only |

**🎯 Use Case Optimization:**

**When MPS Excels:**
- Large file processing (60+ minutes of audio)
- Batch processing (3+ files simultaneously)
- Professional users who regularly process long-form content
- Users with high-end Apple Silicon systems (Pro/Max chips)
- Process large volumes of content (lectures, meetings, podcasts)
- Want maximum performance from their hardware investment
- Need reliable batch processing capabilities
- Value processing speed over power efficiency

#### **When CoreML Might Be Better**

CoreML still has advantages for:
- **Single file processing** (< 30 minutes)
- **Mobile/battery-powered usage** (MacBook Air)
- **Power-efficient processing** (ANE uses less energy)
- **Specific model optimizations** (if available)

#### **Technical Implementation**

The system automatically detects Apple Silicon and configures MPS acceleration:

```python
# Simplified architecture decision
if platform.machine() == 'arm64':  # Apple Silicon
    if batch_size > 3 or file_duration > 60_minutes:
        use_mps_acceleration = True
    else:
        use_coreml_acceleration = True
```

#### **Future Considerations**

As Apple continues to improve both technologies:
- **CoreML**: May gain larger memory allocations in future chips
- **MPS**: Will continue scaling with GPU core counts and memory bandwidth
- **Hybrid approach**: Future versions might dynamically switch based on workload

**Bottom Line**: For the Knowledge System's primary use case (large-scale content processing), MPS provides superior performance, especially on high-end Apple Silicon systems with substantial RAM configurations.

## Cache Management

The Knowledge System includes smart Python cache management to prevent import issues and ensure clean startup:

### Automatic Cache Clearing
The system automatically detects when cache clearing is needed based on:
- Code changes in the project
- Dependency changes (requirements.txt)
- Recent import errors in logs
- Python version changes

When you start the GUI, it will automatically clear cache if needed:
```bash
python -m knowledge_system gui
# Output: 🧹 Cache cleared: recent import errors detected
```

### Manual Cache Management
You can also manage cache manually using CLI commands:

```bash
# Check if cache clearing is recommended
python -m knowledge_system cache status

# Clear cache immediately
python -m knowledge_system cache clear

# Create a flag to force cache clearing on next startup
python -m knowledge_system cache flag
```

### When Cache Clearing Helps
- Import errors (like "module not found" or "missing method")
- Stale module state after code updates
- Dependencies not working correctly after updates
- Application behaving unexpectedly after changes

The cache clearing is smart and only runs when needed, so it won't slow down normal application startup.
