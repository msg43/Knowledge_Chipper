# Auto-Scroll Fix Summary

## Problem
The console output in the GUI was forcibly scrolling to the bottom whenever new log messages were added. This prevented users from scrolling up to read earlier messages, as they would be immediately yanked back down to the bottom as new messages arrived.

## Solution
Implemented "smart scrolling" that only auto-scrolls when the user is already at the bottom of the output. If the user has manually scrolled up, the auto-scroll is suppressed, preserving their scroll position.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Base Tab Component (`src/knowledge_system/gui/components/base_tab.py`)
- Added `_should_auto_scroll()` helper method that checks if the scrollbar is at the bottom (within 10 pixels threshold)
- Modified `append_log()` to check scroll position BEFORE appending, then only auto-scroll if user was at bottom
- Modified `update_last_log_line()` with the same smart scrolling logic

#### 2. Rich Log Display (`src/knowledge_system/gui/components/rich_log_display.py`)
- Updated `_append_formatted_log()` to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

#### 3. Batch Processing Tab (`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/batch_processing_tab.py`)
- Updated `_log_result()` to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

#### 4. FFmpeg Setup Dialog (`src/knowledge_system/gui/dialogs/ffmpeg_setup_dialog.py`)
- Updated progress update method to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

#### 5. Diarization FFmpeg Dialog (`src/knowledge_system/gui/dialogs/diarization_ffmpeg_dialog.py`)
- Updated progress update method to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

#### 6. Cloud Uploads Tab (`src/knowledge_system/gui/tabs/cloud_uploads_tab.py`)
- Updated `_on_upload_progress()` to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

#### 7. Comprehensive First Run Dialog (`src/knowledge_system/gui/dialogs/comprehensive_first_run_dialog.py`)
- Updated `_add_log_message()` to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

#### 8. HCE Update Dialog (`src/knowledge_system/gui/dialogs/hce_update_dialog.py`)
- Updated `_on_progress_update()` to only auto-scroll if user is at the bottom

## Technical Details

### Scroll Detection Logic
```python
def _should_auto_scroll(self) -> bool:
    """Check if the output text widget should auto-scroll."""
    if not hasattr(self, "output_text"):
        return False
    
    scrollbar = self.output_text.verticalScrollBar()
    if not scrollbar:
        return False
    
    # Consider "at bottom" if within 10 pixels of maximum
    # This accounts for rounding and gives a small buffer
    return scrollbar.value() >= scrollbar.maximum() - 10
```

The 10-pixel threshold provides a buffer that:
- Accounts for rounding errors in scroll position
- Makes it easier for users to "snap" to auto-scroll mode by scrolling near the bottom
- Prevents edge cases where a user is "almost" at the bottom but misses by a pixel

### Usage Pattern
1. User scrolls to bottom → new messages auto-scroll (expected behavior)
2. User scrolls up to read → new messages appear but don't move scroll position (fixed!)
3. User scrolls back to bottom → auto-scroll resumes automatically

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Run the test application:
```bash
python test_auto_scroll_fix.py
```

This will open a window that:
1. Starts adding log messages every 500ms
2. Allows you to scroll up while messages are being added
3. Demonstrates that scroll position is preserved when scrolled up
4. Shows auto-scroll resumes when you scroll back to bottom

### Testing in Real Application
1. Start the main GUI application
2. Go to the Transcription tab
3. Start a transcription with a YouTube URL
4. While processing, scroll up to read earlier log messages
5. Verify that you can read without being pulled back down
6. Scroll to bottom and verify auto-scroll resumes

## Benefits
- **Better UX**: Users can now review earlier logs while processing continues
- **Non-disruptive**: Users already at the bottom experience no change
- **Intuitive**: Auto-scroll naturally resumes when user returns to bottom
- **Consistent**: Applied across all tabs that use the console output
