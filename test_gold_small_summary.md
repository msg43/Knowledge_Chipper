## Executive Summary

Gold is soaring again, reaching new all-time highs today, and the mainstream is trying to tell you it's because the dollar is crashing. That couldn't be further from the case. Furthermore, the American economy takes a turn for the worse, that only elevates the need for an error hedge like gold going forward. Moreover, the copper to gold ratio today is a mere fraction of a percentage point above another 40-year low. Ultimately, these ultra-low, ridiculously low levels are everything that we continue to see wrong with the general economy, heading in that direction.
