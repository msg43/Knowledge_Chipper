Gold is soaring again, reaching new all-time highs today, and the mainstream is trying to tell you it's because the dollar is crashing. That couldn't be further from the case. First of all, the dollar is rising again, and historically speaking, when the dollar is rising, that tends to be good for gold overall. In fact, these signals are consistent with what we're seeing in interest rates, and if you had any doubt remaining about any of it, just look at the copper to gold ratio, which tells you why all of this is happening.

The American economy takes a turn for the worse, that only elevates the need for an error hedge like gold going forward. And under those conditions, funding in the Euro-Dollar system is going to be problematic, maybe even more deflationary like in March and April, so that means the rising dollar exchange value not falling.

And you can't possibly get a better, more accurate confirmation for that than the copper to gold ratio, which today is a mere fraction of a percentage point above another 40-year low of its own.

And these ultra-low, ridiculously low levels that we've been getting more recently are everything that we continue to see wrong with the general economy, heading in that direction. All roads leading to low interest rates that stay low for a lot longer, and more importantly, the conditions that bring all of this about, and it's not tariff inflation.
