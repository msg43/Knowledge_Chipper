00:00 - 00:30 We began this all the way back in Classroom Video #2, which I consider to be the first real classroom video at Uradala University. Emil and I began talking right away about collateral. We examined, at least from the outside, the motivations behind why anyone would want to, say, transform a junk bond using a US Treasury, where they came from, who was in the middle, some of the basics behind collateral transformation.

00:30 - 01:00 talked about the collateral multiplier, which is a key part of this transformation and key part of the system in general. But over the months that we've been doing this, all the classroom videos in between, we haven't really taken an in-depth look at the securities lending process and what really goes on, where this collateral multiplier comes from, and why it can be so important. Beginning with Classroom Video #16, we've been working our way towards moving through the background material, the history behind

01:00 - 01:30 borrowing US Treasury, some of the basic concepts, the standardization, legal matters, the 1980s into the 1990s, using different forms of collateral, but until now, we really haven't gone straight at it. Securities lending, how it works, how it's accounted for, and where does this darn collateral multiplier come from? That's what we're going to do here in Classroom Video #21, set up the next series in our Classroom Videos to examine the

01:30 - 02:00 collateral multiplier securities lending to pull it apart, to look at it in depth and detail, so that we can understand this key facet of the EUR/USD system. As usual in our Classroom Videos, we begin with a little bit of review, the same review, to keep in mind that there is no physical cash here. Though in this video, we're not going to talk about cash all that much, we're going to focus mostly on

02:00 - 02:30 securities and securities for securities swaps, or collateral for collateral swaps. But that just makes this advice doubly so, because there are no physical securities here either. Even though the collateral system is every bit like a currency, which we're already straying off the traditional path of money and currency anyway, it isn't physical exchange, it's all electronic book entry, ledger stuff, ledger collateral in this case. And because it's electronic book entry, and for a lot of different reasons, as I went

02:30 - 03:00 over in the first video of our basic series, which I recommend you check out if you haven't already, the EUR/USD system, and especially this collateral component to it, looks a lot like a telecommunications network, then maybe what you're used to, what you're taught, is a monetary global reserve currency system. This is especially the case here in the collateral part of it. So before we get started in the bulk of Classroom Video #21, a little bit of review of where

03:00 - 03:30 we've been so far. We had Classroom Video #19, where we talked about the history and background behind borrowing US Treasuries, particularly the motivation behind it, which was to get around constraints, banks getting around constraints. At that time, they had to have US Treasuries in hand in order to print actual currency. The government did it on their behalf. And if they didn't have Treasuries or couldn't obtain them, they borrowed them. Sort of a preview of what would happen in the latter half of the 20th century.

03:30 - 04:00 As that background process, the ability to borrow US Treasuries, which kind of flew under the radar under the surface of the first half of the 20th century, suddenly would explode in the second half for different reasons. Remember, we also had, we talked about electronic settlement, moving this from physical transactions, paper transactions, having to keep track of and an actual ledger of every little transaction. That was a limitation on scale and efficiency.

04:00 - 04:30 As we mentioned in Classroom Video #20, we're moving to electronic settlement, which creates the ledger environment, which allows for mass production and mass scale of this part and every part of the Eurodollar ledger money system. Standardization, particularly in repo, because remember, repo stands for repurchase agreement, which is not what a repo is. A repo is really a collateralized loan, which puts a lot of emphasis on the collateral.

04:30 - 05:00 Repo actually was because some people treated it as a repurchase agreement, the actual transfer of title between securities, though that will prove to be the case. But what that actually meant for both counterparties, it needed to go through several layers of legal, legal wrangling before it could be standardized along with electronic settlement to open the door to mass producing a collateralized monetary system. And finally, we left off in Classroom Video #20, talking

05:00 - 05:30 about how in the 1990s in particular, suddenly the federal government found itself with more tax receipts than expenses and had the nasty habit of issuing fewer yes treasuries at a time when collateralized lending and collateralized part of the Eurodollar system for repo as well as derivatives was just taking off. So how did the Eurodollar banks solve this constraint? Well, they did so in the same way that

05:30 - 06:00 banks in the earlier days had borrowing US treasuries, as well as, as I mentioned in Classroom Video, the point of Classroom Video #20, coming up with new forms of treasuries. Remember, there was mortgage bonds and ABS securities, private label stuff, as well as government guaranteed securities that functioned in every bit, at least assumed to be every bit like US treasuries as collateral. And another way in which the banking system sought to expand the reach of collateralized

06:00 - 06:30 arrangements was what we're going to talk about today, the collateral multiplier, taking a limited amount of good quality collateral and reusing it as many times as necessary in order to transfer collateral to where it needs to go, make more out of what there is, all using securities lending practices. Now I had mentioned a couple of videos back, I teased this Drysdale

06:30 - 07:00 story. This is from back in May of 1982. Drysdale was this little rinky dink securities broker that had done a bunch of hedge fund strategies, but essentially it required them borrowing US treasuries from, I think it was Citigroup in particular. And what had happened is this strategy wasn't working out very well for Drysdale. And as a result, they found themselves keeping the coupons, which I know should raise some questions

07:00 - 07:30 already because they had borrowed securities from a bank that had borrowed securities from its customers and maybe from other banks too. So there was reuse and real pledging. How in the world can Drysdale keep treasury coupons that were paid to Drysdale, not the original owner of the securities? That's the dirty little secret behind securities lending and what we're going to spend a lot of time talking about today. But either way, what happened was in May 1982, Drysdale said, you know, it was Chase, not Citigroup,

07:30 - 08:00 but Chase has said to Chase, we just got paid from a lot of coupon money from the US government. And we know we're supposed to give it to you because you're supposed to pass it along to the people on these treasuries, but we're keeping it because if we don't, we're out of business. We're highly leveraged in the way that we've become familiar in this day and age, but back then this was sort of unheard of. But either way, what happened was we're breaking down the chain of who owns securities

08:00 - 08:30 as well as who gets paid when those securities mature, if they happen to be in possession, as well as who gets paid the coupon along the way. And securities lending, the very name itself, makes it seem like everything goes to the original owner. You buy a US Treasury, you own it. That means all the coupons and all the proceeds that come from that security accrue to you. And they do accrue to you, but not in the way that you think. This is more complicated,

08:30 - 09:00 which only opens the door to all this fungibility that we talk about. So in the case of Drysdale, what happened was 30 brokers who had lent their securities to Chase, who then relent those securities to Drysdale, didn't realize that in doing so, there was so much relending and that they were at risk of this coupon process breaking down. When Drysdale said, we're not paying the coupons back like we're supposed to, everybody said, where's our money? And Chase eventually was forced to make whole

09:00 - 09:30 though there was very much lots of concern, even up to the level of the Federal Reserve where nobody really knew how this was going to play out because this was a brand new problem that nobody had really expected nor really thought through the consequences. So Drysdale took advantage of, I don't want to say it's a loophole, but a technicality that allowed all of this to happen where essentially securities lending

09:30 - 10:00 isn't really securities lending. And the way in which the securities lending actually is different is the whole reason or the whole way in which securities lending itself can happen. And it's not straightforward what I'm talking about right now, but it's an important understanding. It's important to understand the distinction here. What I'm trying to say in various succinct terms is securities lending is not securities lending at all. That's just a misnomer.

10:00 - 10:30 I don't want to say better, but make it sound different than what actually goes on here. And the Drysdale affair, as it came to be called, exposed this practice for what it really is, hypothecation. That leads us into the collateral multiplier. Now, for the next little bit here, the next part of this video, we're going to talk about a report that was written in the 1990s, July, 1999 by Ayasco,

10:30 - 11:00 which is the International Organization of Securities Commissions. I think it was also co-written by somebody from the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, but an international organization that is made up of people who are interested in settling securities, securities markets, of which the securities lending business had become a huge part. One of the reasons I like these contemporaneous reports is because it's not filtered through the post 2008 lens of,

11:00 - 11:30 let's pretend this stuff doesn't happen. Rather, it's a more unfiltered look at something that had become an extremely vital part of the overall monetary system. Though they consider this to be finance, not really money, at Euridale University, we know better. This is really an integral part of the monetary system. And this integral part of the monetary system developed, of course, in the 1960s into the 1970s.

11:30 - 12:00 As I said before, in our previous video, borrowing US treasuries had been a common practice before then, but it started to become a more common and even demanded practice around the 1960s with the advent in telecommunications technology, as well as the movement to electronic settlement that unlocked the potential here to mass produce and mass scale, borrowing and lending, not borrowing and lending, but the transfer of securities for different purposes beyond

12:00 - 12:30 strictly purchases and sales. As we talked about before in a classroom video here in Euridale University and IOSCO makes plain in July, 1999, the 1980s saw a rapid increase in the amount of securities lending transactions taking place in their jurisdiction. Keep in mind too, this is only what is observed, not necessarily the complete extent of what's going on.

12:30 - 13:00 Because there's always those shadow parts of the global monetary system, global Euridale system, the real shadows where nobody really sees anything except for the parties involved. So we had a massive increase in US treasuries that were issued in the 70s into the 1980s that facilitated the availability of collateral for this growing and increasing demand for repurchase agreements as well as other parts of the Euridale system. Remember, to securitize and collateral

13:00 - 13:30 ize the arrangements were one way of moving beyond small scale transactions where you had to know the counterparty on the other side. You had to know something about them, what their business was, reputation. But if you could have the standardized collateralized practice, you wouldn't need to know anything about who you were lending cash to. You would only need to know about general types of collateral that you accepted from those counterparties. It made it much easier to expand and grow this wholesale

13:30 - 14:00 monetary technique to much larger scale, which that happened especially in the 1980s, leading to all of the excesses in the 1990s, including the Solomon Brothers episode that I talked about in the early 1990s, which is related to all this. And again, as Iosco made clear late 1999, it wouldn't have been possible without electronic bookkeeping as well as settlement infrastructure, which had a lot to do with all those legal,

14:00 - 14:30 legal court cases and establishing standardized accounting, which is important. We'll get into that in just a minute here too. But essentially all the back office needs to make sure that securities lending like repurchase agreements and repo could move forward at high scale. And then of course, offshore, offshore, because this is the Euridale system, because there's not much

14:30 - 15:00 regulation, there's a little bit, but not more internal constraints than anything. Securities lending like a lot of balance sheet activities moved outside the United States in the 1980s, just for a variety of reasons. As the Iosco report says, US securities firms and UK money lenders, they started to develop the offshore securities markets from way back. They started to partner them. That's why the Euridale system is called Euridale. That's why it's sent

15:00 - 15:30 to Euridale. And it means that the securities lending and Euridale, all the different facets of it could reach more and more parts of the world. Because as being a big part or being offshore meant being able to meet the needs of customers, whatever those needs were, in very efficient and flexible fashion. And doing so by marrying this collateralized part of the Euridale

15:30 - 16:00 system with those, that flexibility in the desire to meet the needs of customers meant that you could really mass produce wholesale markets, which is what happened in the 1980s into the 1990s. So being offshore, as well as all of those other factors that we just talked about were key parts of making securities lending into what it came to be, which was scale, huge scale. Even by July 1999,

16:00 - 16:30 the Iosco admitted, and this report is also published by the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS too. So it's not like they didn't know this stuff was going on. They just pretended it was not their job. They pretended this was just some weird transaction, some financial transaction that banks got involved with. But securities lending has become a central part of securities market activity to a point where daily volume of securities transactions for financing purposes

16:30 - 17:00 considerably exceeds that of outright purchase and sale transactions. Again, July of 1999, we're already seeing the securities lending business far exceeding the day-to-day transactions of purchase and sales. To give you an idea of how prevalent this had become, and therefore how important and crucial it was to the operation of the Euridale system.

17:00 - 17:30 And also to reemphasize the shadow nature of it, most of this took place in the shadows. It took place between a couple different counterparties, usually someone who wants to borrow a security, someone who has a security that they're willing to lend, and usually a dealer or intermediary stuck in between, not an official triparty, like triparty repo, maybe just times it's a broker or a custodian, some intermediary, but usually between those three counterparties,

17:30 - 18:00 those three participants in the transaction, nobody knew what was going on. It was very difficult to track. And because of the favorable nature of the accounting, the favorable nature of how securities lending was treated securities lending, it proliferated far and wide in the shadows, not just in the over counter of the market, but bilateral bespoke. And so there's not a lot of information. They were admitting back in July, 1999, we had, we know there's a lot going on there,

18:00 - 18:30 but we don't really know what's going on there. We don't know enough about on a transaction level detail or even an aggregate portfolio detail level of detail, just how, what's really happening here? How much, where are the potential for problems and bottlenecks? What they're saying is, we know there's a lot of this going on, but we don't know how to really keep track of it, which should have set off any number of alarm bells. Remember, this is July in 1899. This is eight years before the actual monetary

18:30 - 19:00 crisis, which would involve this stuff intricately. So there should have been some sort of effort from that point on to make a more determined effort to look into all of this stuff because it had become such a big deal. And that big deal started with the fact that the whole thing only works with this one caveat in mind. As the IOSCO report said in July,

19:00 - 19:30 Let me say that again. Lending a structure to give the borrower legal title to the securities for the life of transaction, even though the terms are more akin to a loan. It allows the borrower, the securities to deliver them onward to re lend them because if you don't own the securities,

19:30 - 20:00 the security that's in your possession, how can you legally re lend it or reuse it? So one of the main points of this video right here, securities lending is not securities lending. It is securities transactions where the transaction is a exchange of ownership. So if I buy a US treasury, and this gets us back to Drysdale, I buy a US treasury and I lend it to

20:00 - 20:30 Chase Bank, Chase Bank, I give Chase Bank legal title to the US treasury. And then Chase Bank having legal title to the US treasury can then re lend it to Drysdale securities. And as far as the US government is concerned or any issue or the debt is concerned, Drysdale is the owner of the security. Even though I own it and not only do I own it, I still show it on the book on my own books as does Chase. Even though Chase borrowed the securities from me and then re lent them to Drysdale,

20:30 - 21:00 Chase shows the ownership of the US Treasuries on its books too or likely does. There's some caveats there. So how does that all work? How can we transfer title but still say that we own the treasures? How do we make this look like securities lending? Well, what it is is actual transferral. There's a couple different accounting conventions. There's also some legal stuff. That's why we talked about the court cases before, but really it comes down to this one part of

21:00 - 21:30 ASC 860-10-40-5C, which is the accounting standards codification and what they call them now used to be FAS. But either way, what happens is if I lend, I buy a US treasury, it's now mine, I own it, but I want to lend it to someone else. If that arrangement comes with a specification where that borrower has to give it back to me under these accounting rules, it means that I maintain effective

21:30 - 22:00 control over the asset. And if I maintain effective control over the asset, it's still my asset, even though I have transferred title to the other person. So in the accounting rules, it states that I'm going to buy a US treasury, I now own it, and I'm going to lend it to somebody else, but only for a specific period of time. And then I specify in that agreement the conditions and the period when they have to give it back to me. That means I maintain effective control

22:00 - 22:30 of the security, therefore I can report that security on my books, even though I have given effective title away to another counterparty. As it says specifically, it's an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transfer to repurchase or redeem the security at maturity. So there is a maturity. And as long as we do that, the accounting rules say I have effective control over the asset, which is this would never work

22:30 - 23:00 Otherwise, if I'm an insurance company, I own a lots of securities. And if this was actually securities lending where I lent you the actual security and I had to report that I lent the security that I no longer own it, insurance companies would never be able to do that. Pension funds, they would never be able to do that. And so a huge source of collateral for securities lending would never be able to get themselves involved with lending. They have to be able to report that continuous ownership of those instruments.

23:00 - 23:30 And because of this, the accounting conventions and the legal legal standards that have been developed around these types of transactions, they can do that, which means that we don't actually lend and we're not actually lending securities. We're hypothesizing them. So remember back in classroom video number two, where we talked about again, the general motivations where a hedge fund would get involved with a dealer to transform junk bonds into US Treasuries.

23:30 - 24:00 By borrowing the treasuries from the insurance company. Well, how does that work in the actual accounting? Well, in the terms of the accounting, the securities borrower, which in this case would be the dealer, not the hedge fund. The dealer would have to make a couple of accounting entries where it recorded the receipt of the US Treasury, which it is now taking title and possession of. It would also have to reclassify those securities and create the obligation to return them, which makes this all work under the accounting rules.

24:00 - 24:30 The securities lender, which in this case is the insurance company, doesn't have to make any entry whatsoever. And I checked this in a couple of different sources to make sure it was true because it's one of those things that sounds like it shouldn't be true, but yeah, there it is. And it's one of those, it's one of those like securitization, which is it began for, you know, the rules were developed for different purposes for real. I mean, obvious that they had a real reason behind them that kind of got moved away from the original purpose and intent and sort of bastardized

24:30 - 25:00 and expanded into what we see today, the securities lending that is really something else. And as far as the other leg of the transaction, as far as the insurance company goes, in this case, there wouldn't be an entry because the dealer bank is taking possession of the junk bonds on behalf of the hedge fund. But in case that the insurance company was lending its US Treasuries directly to a hedge fund, it still wouldn't have to record any transaction unless the hedge fund defaulted and didn't give back the US Treasury and the hedge

25:00 - 25:30 and the insurance company had to had to seize the asset and sell them. So as far as the insurance companies books go, there's nothing there. They still own US Treasuries, even though the US Treasuries has been moved in this case to the dealer. And the dealer is then able to relend and reuse because it has title and I don't say ownership, it has title over the securities and its possession. Then when the transaction ends, we just unwind everything.

25:30 - 26:00 The securities bower in this case, the dealer, all the transactions are just the opposite of those going in. And here's the only time that you see anything for the insurance company that has lent the US Treasury out. It has to record the receipt of this spread or this fee that it's collected in order to lend out its US Treasury, which is the entire motivation for them to do it. Insurance companies have to have the US Treasuries in their possession the whole time. What they're really seeking to do is enhance the return on them by pocketing a fee for lending them out.

26:00 - 26:30 In this fashion, that's what they do. So all you see from the insurance company's perspective is you get more income on those assets. You don't realize that those assets might be all out there somewhere in the offshore hinterlands of the shadow money system. So let's think about what actually happens here on an individual transaction. Let's talk about a securities lender and a securities borrow securities like doesn't matter who this is. Somebody buys a US Treasury and now

26:30 - 27:00 has it in their possession. Somebody let's let's assume they have a junk bond and want to transform. They want to borrow the US Treasury and they're willing to put up their junk bond as collateral in order to do so. So what actually happens here is the securities lender transfers title to the securities borrower. And then the securities borrower, what they do is they create a contractual obligation, first of all, to give the US Treasury back to the securities lender when the securities lender wants it or

27:00 - 27:30 according to the specifications in the contract, as well as there's also a part of the agreement to pay any accrued interest in any payments while that Treasury is in their possession. So back to Drysdale. Drysdale had titled to the US Treasury is that they'd borrowed from Chase that Chase had borrowed from these other dealers. And what had replaced those Treasuries, not on the books, but in actual cash flow context was that Drysdale promised to pay

27:30 - 28:00 all collected income receipts, all the coupon payments from the US government to Chase and then Chase had promised to pay those back to the original lenders. So title goes with whoever has possession of the Treasury and in the wake of that transfer of title, we have all of these Hypothecation agreements along the way. So as far as the securities lender in our example here is concerned, they don't have a US Treasury. They have an agreement from a counterparty who agrees to give them

28:00 - 28:30 back the Treasury as well as give them all the coupon and interest payments they're owed during the time when it is not in their possession. We've created a ghost security. We've created something that didn't exist before because now there are essentially two Treasuries, even though that those two Treasuries only pay one coupon payment. So there are two securities that can be sold, but only one in actual existence because there's one on the books of the securities lender, even though it's not

28:30 - 29:00 there, the securities lender only takes advantage of some accounting rules as well as this agreement to get paid interest while this Treasury is gone. And then the Treasury being gone is on the books of now the securities bower who is able to do whatever they need to do with it. And another thing we need to point out here before we go forward is that usually these standardized agreements say, they don't say you have to give the securities lender back their original Treasury, you have to give them back one that is similar enough.

29:00 - 29:30 It's not always the same security. As long as it's generally the same, it satisfies these arrangements. Again, these are standardized to make it easier for these transactions to take place. But the point here, Hypothecation. We're creating new securities from nothing and accounting for not much, almost nothing along the way. And so because of the way this transaction is structured, you can imagine, we'll just keep doing it again.

29:30 - 30:00 And the securities borrower say they don't have an immediate need for this US Treasury. They borrow. Maybe they thought they were going to do something with it. Maybe they didn't. Now they can re lend that security to securities borrower number two, which in our example before was Drysdale Securities, who does the same thing. They simply pledge to give them back similar enough US, similar enough security doesn't have to be US Treasuries and to pay any coupon payments or interest income along the way so that it continues to go flow backward.

30:00 - 30:30 Payments flow backward to the original and we continue to Hypothecate new securities as we go forward. Which brings us to the modern practice where we start to we Hypothecate forward more and more and more. So we have our original lender that owns the US Treasury that's transferred the title to the borrower. Maybe there's some junk bonds involved here as collateral. Maybe there's not. It doesn't really matter at this stage because all we're doing is we're creating

30:30 - 31:00 new Treasuries on the books of these borrowers as well as the original owners one after another after another each one promising to pay backwards any interest payments and to give back similar Treasury securities at the request of the title holder holder in line from before them. So borrower number one can ask for Treasuries back from borrower number two and borrower number two would have to get them from somewhere else. Maybe it could get them from borrower number three or

31:00 - 31:30 maybe instead borrower number one or number two or whoever it is. Let's assume in this case the original owner wants its Treasury securities back because it no longer wants and no longer likes the junk bonds that is holding as collateral for its original Treasury collateral. What is borrower number one to do in this situation because now the actual Treasury is two steps removed. Does it contact borrower number two and say I need my Treasury back and the borrower number two has to contact borrower

31:30 - 32:00 number three. That's certainly an option and if that's the case you can see how that would collapse what is essentially our collateral multiplier because here we have one US Treasury security that is reused three times. So that's a collateral multiplier of four. You know it's there's one Treasury security plus the three uses that's that's four. I think that's that's right. That's my math right. Check my arithmetic four. So we have four Treasury securities

32:00 - 32:30 one real three. Hypothricated. We have a collateral multiplier of four because it's been reused into four different places. Let's assume again the original owner wants its US Treasury back borrower number one is now in a pickle. Where could it get the Treasury. It could go from it could get it back from borrower number two but that might break some of the agreements that they have a borrower number two depends on the what's going on there. Maybe it would just be easier to borrow another

32:30 - 33:00 Treasury from borrower number six who got the same Treasury from the original owner who was three steps removed there. So now we have two Treasuries floating around to actual Treasury securities. But now we have eight eight instances of people who say they have a Treasury security. And as usual six of them are rehype are hypothecated. I want to say rehypothecated. It's a different thing. We'll get into that in a future video. We have six Hypothecated Treasury securities two

33:00 - 33:30 actual Treasury securities and still the promise to create or to maintain the cash flow chain from the from the very back to the very front. But that's not likely to happen though. Our collateral chains aren't likely to to move in and out of each other. We're not borrower number one is not likely to encounter our borrower number six because where would they even know about them. Instead what's likely to happen is what likely happens in all the Euro dollar environments.

33:30 - 34:00 We've got dealer banks and intermediaries and dealer banks and intermediaries. They're always borrowing Treasuries always buying Treasuries at auction. They're borrowing Treasuries on behalf of hedge funds and other customers. They're getting Treasuries from all sorts of places around the financial system. They're lending them relending them as Chase was doing in the early 1980s. And as Iosco said by July 1999 this was very prevalent. Just huge part of the

34:00 - 34:30 global monetary system already. So we've got dealers and intermediaries that stand inside the system ready to borrow and lend as necessary as if this was a cash system. So borrower number one gets the original lender owner of that part of the collateral chain says I want my US Treasury back. Borrower number one doesn't know where to get it. So it contacts a dealer who has Treasuries and can satisfy that arrangement.

34:30 - 35:00 But it's while that settles that transaction that just means borrower number one has now borrowed the Treasury from a dealer rather than the original owner. And so we have these not just chains of collateral transformations and collateral exchanges. We have this whole system where these these transactions are coming into and out of existence in which dealers perform huge incredibly vital roles intermeeting all of it.

35:00 - 35:30 And so we have the Federal moving back and forth. Multiplications of Treasuries being used and reused and not just Treasuries but other securities too. But primarily let's focus on Treasuries here is being issued bought used reused repledge all over the place creating hypothecated securities on the books of all these places. The only difference here is that again the Treasuries only pay one coupon. So while we show in our example here

35:30 - 36:00 to the right side of the screen we have eight US Treasuries or eight eight parties who say they have US Treasuries. There's only two of them actually paying payments. So you can see why dealers are really an important part of this if no other reason than keeping the books on all of these things who owes what. Otherwise you run into a situation where you get to Drysdale that maybe we have a breakdown or a problem along the way. And that's also why we have in these collateral

36:00 - 36:30 borrowing or collateral securities lending transactions you have to put up other forms of collateral to be involved. So if you're borrowing collateral from a dealer or even lending collateral to a dealer there's usually some kind of either cash or security collateral maybe junk bonds that you have to post to a dealer to get involved in this system to be to be plugged in to all of this collateral flow. What that leaves us with and this is where we're going to end video number 21 here

36:30 - 37:00 it leaves us with a look at what we can start to see the collateral multiplier but that leaves open a bunch of other questions about how what happens when it expands and what happens and how it actually contracts which is what we're going to get into in classroom video number 22. But what I hope you take away here what what's really important is what securities lending actually is and what it actually does and why this

37:00 - 37:30 authentication process is such such it's very important to understand not only in how it lets the let's all of these things work and how it lets the these participants Participate in the system as we need to the insurance companies and pension funds that need to report these treasuries on their books consistently, but also I hope looking ahead how this can create major problems because effectively you look at this collateral multiplier everyone in that

37:30 - 38:00 multiplication chain is effectively short treasuries or they're short the collateral that they've passed along so borrower number one isn't short U.S. Treasuries because they're betting on Treasury prices to go down. They're short U.S. Treasuries because they have an obligation to return something they don't own they don't have in their possession currently to somebody else and if everybody is short U.S. Treasuries or a lot of people are short U.S. Treasuries that's how you end up with a

38:00 - 38:30 situation where something happens in one part of the system that causes essentially a short squeeze That's what we're going to get into in the next classroom video collateral multiple multiplier taking this a little bit step further, but here we are in classroom video 21 finishing up One final point in the short squeeze obviously that would be advantageous to any Participant who has access

38:30 - 39:00 To the the instrument that is being squeezed which just so happens to be Dealers so when we see these U.S. Treasury bill runs that we have we have witnessed over the last several months although More intensely over the last several months. We've witnessed them pretty commonplace over the last 15 years But in these collateral outbreaks who is buying these U.S. Treasury bills at such huge premiums? Well in one part it is these dealers because these dealers know that desperate

39:00 - 39:30 Financial counterparties who are short synthetically all these U.S. Treasuries will have to pay exorbitant privileges to close out their short positions to re re To re give or to give back Treasury securities to the original owners Dealers are a huge part of this part of the system too and that includes them being able to take advantage of when things go wrong including sometimes when they're a part of things going wrong

39:30 - 40:00 This this last quote by the way just to make clear this is also included in the IASCO IASCO July 1999 report Foreexit was a financial institution may borrow Securities on the expectation that others will shortly be Preparing to pay more to borrow them and dealers would know when that situation arises because they can see it in their own activities

40:00 - 40:30 Just to bring this back to where we left off in classroom video number 19 In the middle 1990s we had fewer and fewer Treasury securities the dealer system tried to navigate that and overcome that impediment first by creating more Treasury-like securities or what we thought were Treasury-like securities mortgage-backed securities asset-backed securities things that were taken as Treasuries but really weren't and as the IASCO report was saying in July 1999 this huge explosion

40:30 - 41:00 Of securities lending that isn't actually lending so we have more types of collateral as well as more reusing of collateral in standardized global offshore fashion which meant Rapid monetary expansion especially through the 90s and into 2000s Regardless of the available supply of US Treasuries dealers did what dealers always do which is find a way to expand the monetary system For good and for worse

41:00 - 41:30 So that is going to wrap it up here for classroom video number 21 taking a deeper more specific concrete focus dive into securities lending because It's not really securities lending and because it's not really securities lending That's where everything really came from It sounds better than it actually is this Hypothecation process and again, we're going to talk more about how that can create real problems

41:30 - 42:00 Real monetary problems that lead to financial problems that the even the public becomes aware of there's all sorts of ways in which this Hypothecation reuse and repludging the collateral multiplier can play a role in monetary expansion and monetary contraction We'll save that for next time. Thank you for thank you for joining me. This has been classroom video number 21 securities not lending

42:00 - 42:30 You
