## Full Transcript

**00:01** you know it's more a question of enjoy

**00:02** the party but dance near the door at

**00:04** some stage you know you you have to pay

**00:06** the piper here there's got to be you

**00:08** know at least 2 trillion of new

**00:10** financing every year for the foreseeable

**00:12** future when it comes to the gold price I

**00:14** think you've also got to factor in what

**00:15** the Federal Reserve is doing we're in an

**00:17** environment now where you want to be

**00:18** closer to real assets than financial

**00:21** assets you may make more money in silver

**00:23** in the shortterm but at the end of the

**00:25** day what you want is monetary inflation

**00:27** Hedges and gold is a pretty decent one

**00:28** the gold price doesn't go up gold press

**00:30** actually in reality technically stays

**00:32** where it is gold is the pole star in the

**00:35** financial Sky now is the time to try and

**00:37** create a recession in the

**00:39** US all right how's it going everybody

**00:41** thank you for joining me on this episode

**00:43** of Real Money Talks uh the second one

**00:45** for this week I know and as always I

**00:47** hope you've been having a great week so

**00:49** far but if you haven't then you are of

**00:52** course at the right place and even if

**00:54** you have had a great week then you're

**00:55** still at the right place because Michael

**00:57** how and I are talking about where

**00:58** inflation is going

**01:00** and how much more money printing if if

**01:03** any he is expecting over the coming

**01:05** months as the fiscal and monetary

**01:07** landscape is of course shifting not only

**01:10** on a national level in the US which is a

**01:12** little bit more obvious but also just

**01:13** generally on a global level and of

**01:15** course what we're going to look into how

**01:17** that ties into gold and silver prices of

**01:19** course after Michael though I've got a

**01:21** good old CEO barbecue lined up too

**01:23** actually one of which is going to take

**01:25** us all the way up to the Yukon to look

**01:27** at a 2 million ounce gold dep deposit

**01:30** that's going to be with white gold Corp

**01:32** and see really if there's any potential

**01:34** left there and exploration upside and

**01:37** then the other one will take us down to

**01:38** Nevada to look at Ridgeline minerals and

**01:41** their recent high-grade drill results

**01:44** which they've done in um a partnership

**01:47** that they have with Nevada gold mines

**01:49** but liquidity concerns first because

**01:52** Michael you and I spoke uh what last

**01:54** quarter I believe so I suppose no

**01:56** 10-minute intro needed here everyone

**01:58** knows who you are the liquidity

**02:00** Lighthouse is Sim like to call you

**02:02** although I don't think anyone's ever

**02:03** called you that but I should be the

**02:05** first one lighting the way through the

**02:07** monetary Waters uh but I'm rushing to

**02:09** talk to you about the recent pause that

**02:12** you've noticed in global liquidity

**02:14** expansion which you've said is related

**02:16** to essentially three things so we have

**02:18** the slowdown in Central Bank liquidity

**02:20** growth there's an increased volatility

**02:23** in the bond market and then there's

**02:25** China's Central Bank that has an

**02:28** inconsistent policy action or

**02:30** inconsistent policy actions really

**02:31** multiple so already we're dealing with

**02:34** things that are obviously way over my

**02:35** smooth head so maybe we can try and

**02:38** detangle these by going over those three

**02:41** things kind of separately one by one and

**02:43** see how they really tie into Global

**02:45** Equity as well as of course how do they

**02:47** influence precious metals and I want to

**02:49** kick it off with non-chinese central

**02:52** banks and I'm specifying non-chinese

**02:54** because I I do have other specific

**02:57** questions about the pboc later but so

**03:00** Michael do you expect central banks to

**03:02** keep limiting liquidity growth and if so

**03:05** how is that going to influence gold and

**03:07** silver

**03:08** prices well the true answer is no I

**03:10** don't I don't think they can I think

**03:13** their ability to uh reduce liquidity is

**03:17** very limited um we're in a world of

**03:20** monetary inflation I think that much is

**03:22** clear um the reason we're in world of

**03:25** monetary inflation is there there so

**03:26** much debt out there we're hooked on debt

**03:28** we can't get out of debt debt we keep

**03:30** accumulating debt but debt needs to be

**03:32** refinanced and the only way to refinance

**03:34** debt is really against the backdrop of

**03:36** generous liquidity prision that's what

**03:38** we've been seeing and that's what we're

**03:39** going continue to see over the medium

**03:41** term I think the problems nearer term

**03:44** are basically uh about a number of

**03:46** things uh one of those as you rightly

**03:49** say is that bond market volatility is

**03:51** picked up because the bond markets are

**03:53** sniffing out some of these problems and

**03:55** they don't like what they see uh with

**03:57** this sort of disre disregard among

**03:59** Central Bankers really for uh about

**04:02** inflation and although central banks

**04:04** have this rhetoric that they're trying

**04:05** to kill inflation and hit 2% targets the

**04:09** reality is that uh there's something

**04:11** else going on and I think you just got

**04:13** to see how the Federal Reserve operates

**04:15** to basically realize that the Federal

**04:18** Reserve you know is intent on a 2%

**04:21** Target but how do you measure that 2%

**04:22** Target they give us a range of different

**04:25** indicators uh whether it's PC whether

**04:27** it's core PC uh core cons consum prices

**04:30** whether it's core Services whether it's

**04:32** headline CPI I mean who knows there's a

**04:35** range of these different things could

**04:36** even be wages for all we know um and

**04:39** they seem to miss all of them but they

**04:41** still they cut interest rates um you've

**04:43** also got a situation whereby they don't

**04:46** tell us anything about what happens if

**04:48** they stray away from their targets so in

**04:50** other words if they um if they

**04:52** undershoot inflation what's their

**04:54** reaction function we just don't know

**04:56** they seem to be cutting rates kind of

**04:58** regardless uh that's not just a US

**05:00** phenomenon that seems to be pretty

**05:02** Global so central banks want to cut

**05:04** rates I rather suspect the reason for

**05:07** that is that the debt burden on

**05:10** treasurers around the world is becoming

**05:11** now pretty immense um you know you just

**05:14** got to look at um what's happening with

**05:16** the US to evidence that um you know

**05:19** something like 30% of US debt which is a

**05:22** figure of about well I mean the US debt

**05:25** is a figure of about 36 trillion us um

**05:28** 30% of that has to be financed next year

**05:31** refinanced next year so there's a

**05:32** continual roll over the average interest

**05:35** rate on existing US debt uh is just

**05:38** under 3% so 2.8% in fact which is which

**05:41** represents about a$1 trillion interest

**05:44** bill um the average interest rate across

**05:47** the curve in the US is currently 4.3 and

**05:50** probably Rising further so if you look

**05:52** at that and just do the math um the

**05:55** interest bill is going to rise uh from a

**05:58** trillion dollars this year to .2

**06:00** trillion next year it's that's obviously

**06:02** a 20% jump I mean these things just

**06:05** can't keep going on and therefore

**06:07** there's a great need to keep interest

**06:08** interest cost down which I think is the

**06:11** modus operand behind uh decisions to cut

**06:14** interest rates I think that this is a

**06:16** major thing now what does it tell us

**06:18** about inflation um it says that

**06:21** inflation is a battle which has not been

**06:23** one and basically it's being pushed to

**06:25** the side uh We've long suspected that a

**06:28** Federal Reserve that used the word

**06:29** transitory to describe inflation is not

**06:32** a central bank that really wants to

**06:33** tighten so I think the the backdrop here

**06:35** is that um you know not withstanding

**06:37** short-term problems which are all about

**06:40** Rising bond market volatility you know

**06:42** concerns over maybe Trump's near-term

**06:44** agenda all these sort of things uh are

**06:46** coming to the for and and they're

**06:48** disrupting the supply of liquidity near

**06:50** term the reality is looking longer term

**06:53** unless something is done uh I'm talking

**06:55** here something drastically is done like

**06:58** you know Elon Musk goes in and sort of

**07:00** uh basically cuts out most of the US

**07:03** government or taxes are hiked or

**07:06** whatever I mean unrealistic options uh

**07:08** we're in this road or following this

**07:11** road of more monetary inflation and

**07:13** therefore the gold market does well and

**07:14** I think that you know uh investors out

**07:16** there have just got to look at a very

**07:17** very simple relationship uh since year

**07:20** 2000 the stock of US debt has increased

**07:23** by whopping Eightfold and the price of

**07:25** gold has gone up8 and a quarter times

**07:28** that seems to be a pretty con system

**07:29** relationship in my mind yeah and that's

**07:32** exactly what I why I was asking about

**07:34** this because I'm wondering how Central

**07:36** Bank liquidity growth is related not

**07:40** only to retailing investment demand for

**07:41** precious metals but also to their own

**07:44** demand for precious metals so Central

**07:45** Bank gold buying

**07:47** essentially is there a relationship that

**07:49** you've observed where debt goes up

**07:52** therefore the gold reserves of banks go

**07:54** up or is there any relationship that

**07:55** you've seen there well I think that

**07:58** there there's another there's another um

**08:00** factor out there that you're alluding to

**08:02** which is basically the buying

**08:04** particularly of non-western in other

**08:06** words bricks Banks of gold now this is a

**08:10** comparatively new phenomenon uh and it

**08:12** seems that these central banks are

**08:13** actually buying gold as an alternative

**08:16** to the US dollar uh they're putting

**08:18** their reserves in in bullion um the

**08:21** reserves of the bricks and Friends of

**08:24** the bricks in other words those

**08:26** countries that aspire to join the bricks

**08:28** group uh now surpass uh Holdings us

**08:32** Holdings at Fort Knox so I mean these

**08:34** are not inconsiderable amounts and

**08:36** they're continuing to rise whereas

**08:38** obviously us gold reserves Flatline so

**08:40** you know these are considerations in the

**08:42** longer term now that's telling us that

**08:44** the amount of gold out there uh in

**08:48** private hands is diminishing okay uh par

**08:52** obviously new production but you know on

**08:54** the face of it central banks are buying

**08:56** uh gold from the private sector they're

**08:58** taking it out of circul ation and

**09:00** therefore the private sector has less

**09:01** gold to buy uh on top of the fact that

**09:04** demand from the private sector is

**09:06** building because of monetary inflation

**09:08** features so you

**09:10** know why shouldn't gold go up it does go

**09:13** up uh I mean this is the reality and

**09:15** it's going to keep going up until one of

**09:17** those two factors change uh and I can't

**09:19** see why they

**09:20** should what I'm also thinking about is

**09:23** how stable or how sustainable really is

**09:26** this liquidity growth that we're seeing

**09:28** in this dead growth and everything and

**09:30** yeah I'm thinking about inflation versus

**09:31** deflation but on the other hand I'm also

**09:33** thinking about just the the the

**09:35** stability of the Global Financial system

**09:37** I know this sounds very dire but could

**09:40** could What's Happening Here could this

**09:41** result in a potential Global liquidity

**09:44** crisis at a certain point I mean this

**09:46** cannot keep the liquidity growth cannot

**09:47** keep going on forever

**09:50** right well I mean the answer is that it

**09:54** seemingly can because it has and it's

**09:57** done so for decades um what we're really

**09:59** talking about is um maybe two things two

**10:02** Dimensions one is the is the nominal

**10:05** amount amounts here in other words how

**10:07** much monetary inflation there is I mean

**10:09** clearly if you you know as I said to you

**10:11** earlier on I mean the stock of US debt

**10:13** has gone up eight times um you know in

**10:15** the last 25 years what's the topic going

**10:18** up another eight or 10 times in the next

**10:19** in the following 25 years I mean

**10:21** probably nothing because it will I mean

**10:24** that's the reality of this right uh so

**10:26** one is the sort of uh is the is is how

**10:29** it's denominated the nominal value of

**10:30** that debt uh in other words inflation is

**10:33** going on the whole time so that's that's

**10:35** one dimension and the other is what is

**10:38** the stability of the system so if the

**10:40** direction is upwards the stability is

**10:42** the other question and the stability

**10:44** really relates to uh how easy it is to

**10:47** refinance debt now most financial crisis

**10:51** if not all financial crisis are about

**10:53** liquidity not solvency in other words

**10:55** it's your ability to refinance your

**10:57** positions now uh if you look back and

**11:00** you look at the GFC in 2008 you look at

**11:02** the Asian financial crisis you look at

**11:04** the US repo crisis in 2019 all those

**11:07** were examples of uh uh periods where

**11:10** debt could not be refinanced okay so the

**11:13** central banks had to come in and create

**11:14** more liquidity and the reality is that

**11:16** what we've got out there is a stock of

**11:18** debt which is valued about $350 trillion

**11:22** which has an average maturity of about

**11:24** five years which means simple math that

**11:27** 70 trillion has to be refinanced

**11:29** basically every year now $70 trillion of

**11:32** refinancing is a huge amount and it puts

**11:35** a lot of strain on financial markets and

**11:37** to roll over that amount of debt what

**11:39** you need is balance sheet capacity uh in

**11:42** or balance sheet capacity among credit

**11:43** providers now that is what we Define as

**11:46** liquidity so if you get uh some misstep

**11:49** where debt uh re or the need to refin

**11:53** refinance debt uh exceeds the amount of

**11:56** liquidity in the system then you get a

**11:57** refinancing crisis uh and that's what

**12:00** we've seen historically before if you go

**12:02** to the Other Extreme and you see a lot

**12:04** of liquidity relative to the needs for

**12:06** debt refinancing you tend to get asset

**12:08** price booms now actually as it happens

**12:11** because of low interest rates through

**12:13** the covid period where central banks

**12:16** basically operated zero interest rate

**12:18** policies a lot of debt was turned out um

**12:22** you know into 20 26 27 28 Etc uh and

**12:26** that is the so-called maturity War which

**12:28** is coming back to bite markets in the

**12:30** next few years probably begins about the

**12:32** middle of next year and basically those

**12:35** borrowers will have to refinance those

**12:37** positions now that will take liquidity

**12:40** and you know we've been in a luxurious

**12:42** position for maybe four to five years

**12:44** now that hasn't really needed to be a

**12:46** lot of debt refinancing uh inflation has

**12:49** been you know erratic but uh it's been

**12:52** up and it's been down uh that's taken

**12:54** some liquidity out of the system but

**12:56** generally there's been sufficient

**12:57** liquidity to create to fuel asset price

**13:00** booms the question is looking forward

**13:02** you've got three big challenges number

**13:05** one is that the underlying level of

**13:07** inflation in the world economy may be

**13:09** higher and that will sap liquidity

**13:11** number two as you alluded to that China

**13:13** is a major uncertainty here uh and China

**13:16** is a dollarized economy that uses vast

**13:18** amounts of the US currency and the third

**13:22** thing is this debt maturity World which

**13:23** will need refinancing

**13:26** so whether the global liquidity cycle is

**13:28** EXP expanding or not you've got

**13:30** increasing demands on that and one of

**13:32** the problems about the statement about

**13:34** global equility you know expanding is

**13:37** that increasing bomb Vol bomb Market

**13:39** volatility basically dents near-term

**13:42** growth in global global liquidity Supply

**13:44** anyway and those are the concerns we've

**13:46** really got so you know we're not saying

**13:49** bail out now this is the end uh you know

**13:52** it's more a question of enjoy the party

**13:53** but dance near the door um that's the

**13:56** sort of the the investment message h

**13:59** but liquidity in the US specifically

**14:02** with the FED seems to be well it's

**14:03** showing signs of stabilizing right now

**14:06** um if it do well I mean do you think it

**14:10** can do you think the market is pricing

**14:11** in a longer term slowdown in liquidity

**14:14** or a stabilization and if it actually

**14:17** did happen what what does that mean for

**14:20** markets well I don't think the market

**14:22** looks sufficiently liquidity so I don't

**14:23** think they've really priced it in I mean

**14:25** this has been this over over fixation on

**14:29** interest rates but we're in a world I

**14:31** mean this is the point that we keep

**14:32** making is that if you pick up economics

**14:34** or Finance textbooks what they keep

**14:36** telling you is that Capital markets are

**14:37** all about interest rates and about

**14:39** raising capital for New for new uh

**14:42** investment projects um that was the

**14:45** world we used to be in 50 years ago it's

**14:46** not the world we're in now we're in a

**14:48** world where Capital markets are all

**14:49** about debt refinancing that debt

**14:52** refinancing mechanisms actually whopping

**14:54** or huge uh debt refinancing mechanisms

**14:57** and that's all about balance sheet

**14:58** capacity it's not about interest rates

**15:00** so this fixation That central banks push

**15:03** us towards and the media you know

**15:04** persuades us it's all important you know

**15:06** what's fed funds rate going to do uh

**15:08** tomorrow or whatever is completely

**15:10** meaningless in a lot of

**15:12** ways what if the if the FED introduces U

**15:16** technical changes as you've written

**15:18** about too recently that kind of

**15:19** increased liquidity but much more subtly

**15:22** than what we're used to so far do you

**15:24** think that's going to have an effect on

**15:26** commodity prices like gold and silver or

**15:28** do you think the the impacts going to

**15:30** remain

**15:31** marginal yeah I think I think it is

**15:33** going to have an effect I going to have

**15:35** a major effect because you know at some

**15:38** stage you know you you have to pay the

**15:40** piper here uh and you know you can you

**15:43** can massage markets manipulate markets

**15:45** for so long but at the end of the day

**15:47** you you kind of you you've got to as I

**15:50** say pay the piper I mean there's no

**15:52** there's no getting away from that and

**15:53** the problem that you've got right now is

**15:56** that the treasury and the FED have been

**15:58** uh remarkably successful in holding bond

**16:03** yields down I mean we think that if you

**16:04** look at the US Treasury Market at the

**16:06** 10-year tener um yields should be about

**16:09** 100 basis points higher than they

**16:11** currently are and the reason that

**16:13** they've been suppressed is that the

**16:15** treasur has been doing what we've

**16:16** Loosely dubbed as not yield curve

**16:19** control yield curve control it's an

**16:21** unconventional yield curve control but

**16:23** they're doing it and that's through

**16:24** largely through a mechanism of um uh

**16:28** increasing issuance at the short end of

**16:30** the market so they're doing a lot of

**16:31** Bill issuance for example in October

**16:34** last month they issued almost two

**16:36** trillion dollar of treasury bills Now

**16:39** set against the US debt uh outstanding

**16:42** of 36 trillion that's quite a meaningful

**16:43** amount for one month right uh so they're

**16:46** doing a lot of Bill financing uh they're

**16:48** doing a lot of financing in terms of

**16:50** very short-term uh maturity coupons so

**16:53** two five or 2 three five year coupons uh

**16:58** those are short-term bonds of that of

**17:00** that maturity and they're really

**17:03** starving the market at least temporarily

**17:05** of longer dated debt which is the reason

**17:08** that yields are probably below where

**17:09** they should be but we know there's a lot

**17:12** of debt coming in the future of all

**17:14** Stripes so there's got to be you know at

**17:16** least two trillion of new financing

**17:18** every year for the foreseeable future

**17:20** arguably more than that uh and there'll

**17:23** be a lot of a lot of that will be coupon

**17:26** um in other words there's been a sort of

**17:27** a short-term lip whereby the percentage

**17:30** of US Government debt in treasury bills

**17:34** or short dated debt has picked up

**17:35** significantly the share has gone up but

**17:38** the share can't keep Rising it's got to

**17:39** level out at some stage which means that

**17:41** coupon supply has got to at the longer

**17:43** end has got to pick up and that will

**17:45** actually put a lot more pressure on

**17:46** yields so you've got this problem now if

**17:49** yields keep going up um then the

**17:52** interest bill of the US government

**17:53** starts to Skyrocket and this is really

**17:56** the the the problem that not just the us

**17:58** but everybody really has to face and you

**18:01** know if you if you're suppressing yields

**18:03** by 100 basis points across the curve

**18:05** let's say you've saved the US taxpayer

**18:09** uh or you've saved the US Treasury uh

**18:11** the need for $350 billion of of funding

**18:14** I mean these are these are big amounts

**18:16** so it pays for them to do this and

**18:18** they're they're doing it and then on top

**18:20** of that the Federal Reserve is

**18:21** increasing liquidity through what we

**18:23** call not uh qqe where they're basically

**18:27** you know allowing debt to roll their

**18:29** balance sheet but they're basically

**18:30** pushing liquidity in through other means

**18:33** uh they they don't want to you know they

**18:35** they don't want to crash the markets and

**18:36** you know as my uh former boss at sarm

**18:39** Brothers Henry calman sort of very uh

**18:41** very um uh cleverly pointed out uh two

**18:45** or three years ago that a Federal

**18:47** Reserve that uses the term transitory to

**18:50** describe inflation is a central bank

**18:52** that doesn't really want to Titan and

**18:54** this is this is what's going on so

**18:56** they're letting inflation basically run

**18:58** away H I mean not at not at super high

**19:00** levels but sufficiently um you know

**19:03** whereby it becomes a nagging problem and

**19:05** you know the issue for Equity investors

**19:07** generally is that you know they're being

**19:10** excoriated if you like by uh a sort of

**19:13** naggingly high inflation rate and a bond

**19:16** yield that is forever creeping up so

**19:18** we're sort of being sandpaper to death

**19:20** slowly rather like we saw in uh or

**19:24** markets saw in the late

**19:25** 1980s uh when you know for a long time

**19:28** the Equity markets decoupled from the

**19:30** fixed income markets until they didn't

**19:32** and then there was the crash so these

**19:35** are problems we've got to

**19:37** face that really begs the question as to

**19:39** why and that may be the most important

**19:41** thing here that also that this maybe

**19:43** doesn't have a very specific answer but

**19:45** the decision-making process what do you

**19:47** think that's mostly driven by I mean are

**19:49** they becoming more data dependent again

**19:51** or are they still constrained and and

**19:53** commanded by other pressures I mean

**19:56** fiscal and political and whatever else

**19:57** may have you

**20:00** well I I think they're pressured by by

**20:02** fiscal problems uh you know I would

**20:04** suspect that the reason that rates are

**20:06** being cut um uh not just in the US but

**20:09** even if you look at the UK with the bank

**20:11** of England where it's difficult to argue

**20:13** that inflation is is seriously under

**20:15** control I must admit in all these

**20:17** countries but policy makers still want

**20:18** to cut rates um I think they're being

**20:21** Guided by the interest Bill their

**20:24** governments face they want to get that

**20:25** interest bill down and they see The

**20:27** Cutting policy r at the short end is a

**20:29** mechanism to do that uh but they've got

**20:32** to face the problem uh which is a

**20:34** problem that emerged in the 1980s of

**20:36** Bond vigilantes if the bond markets or

**20:39** Bond investors start to believe that

**20:41** these fiscal policies are unsustainable

**20:43** uh then they're going to go on a buyer

**20:45** strike and allow yields to push up and

**20:47** that's the problem we've got now in the

**20:49** case of the US it's a little bit more

**20:51** knife edged than it was in the 1980s for

**20:54** the simple reason that what you got is a

**20:57** very unusual cast of buyers at the

**20:59** margin of the US Treasury Market um the

**21:02** US long-term institutions the Pension

**21:05** funds and the life funds have really

**21:07** been squeezed out uh of the market

**21:09** they're not really big buyers so much

**21:12** and at the margin it's basically been

**21:14** hedge funds uh who have been doing a

**21:16** basis trade in other words they've been

**21:18** buying the cash market and shorting the

**21:19** Futures uh through an Arbitrage now that

**21:22** works until it doesn't but what that

**21:24** really is dependent upon is some

**21:26** stability in the bond markets you don't

**21:27** want B volatility to pick up and what

**21:30** have we seen in the last few weeks is

**21:32** Bond volatility has jumped significantly

**21:34** now it has fallen back admittedly since

**21:36** the election uh but it's still you know

**21:38** over a 100 uh whereas the long-term

**21:41** average on the Move index is near a 70

**21:44** and that corresponds toward a Circa 7%

**21:47** volatility across the curve so you're

**21:49** you know you're roughly speaking 50%

**21:51** higher levels of volatility than we

**21:53** normally see I definitely want to get to

**21:55** the bond issue or whatever is happening

**21:57** in the bond market right now but I want

**21:59** to St by China first because what the

**22:02** pboc the Chinese Central

**22:04** Bank has been doing is they've been

**22:07** showing inconsistency in the speed at

**22:09** which they've been injecting money into

**22:11** their system essentially is this

**22:13** Behavior more typical of larger

**22:14** underlying economic and debt issues or

**22:17** are they just being strategic and and

**22:18** proactive with their actions here well I

**22:21** think they've been consistent in the

**22:23** sense they've been consistently negative

**22:25** so I'd say that that's that's what we've

**22:27** seen recent Rec and I don't think

**22:30** they're being strategic I think they're

**22:31** being actually tactical and I think that

**22:34** the you know what you've got going on in

**22:36** China is number one still a desire to

**22:41** stabilize the Yuan as much as they can

**22:44** and you know this is a big big thing in

**22:46** China they they they seemingly want the

**22:48** uan to basically Peg itself closely to

**22:51** the US dollar um and they're prepared to

**22:54** tighten monetary policy in the short

**22:55** term to do that now that may be as I

**22:57** said tactic

**22:59** because the election or prospective

**23:01** election of trump um and the fact you've

**23:04** now got Trump winning the election means

**23:07** that their eyes are focused on what that

**23:09** would mean for the Chinese economy and

**23:11** what that would mean for tariffs um and

**23:14** clearly that will focus the mind and

**23:15** probably what they are concerned about

**23:18** is exchange rate weakness in the near

**23:20** term if the markets or if Chinese

**23:23** investors themselves think that this is

**23:25** actually very bad news so they've got a

**23:28** very type monetary stance now does that

**23:30** tell us anything about the longer term I

**23:33** don't think so uh the Chinese have sort

**23:35** of alluded to a package today which

**23:38** would suggest they are prepared to um

**23:41** issue maybe 10 trillion Yuan uh so just

**23:45** over a trillion maybe a trillion and a

**23:48** bit uh or in dollar terms of debt uh I

**23:52** think if you want to scale that um it

**23:55** probably should be nearer 2 to three

**23:57** trillion

**23:59** uh pretty much equivalent to what the US

**24:01** did after the

**24:03** GFC maybe China's problems are bigger so

**24:06** perhaps we're talking more about three

**24:08** trillion but hey this is a start doesn't

**24:10** rule out further increases but the most

**24:13** important thing out of this is how is it

**24:15** financed and we don't really know that

**24:18** um and there could be you know people

**24:20** can speculate but we really don't know

**24:21** we don't want to know for months how

**24:23** it's financed because is it going to is

**24:25** that money going to be raised from

**24:26** long-term Savers in China in which case

**24:28** it's not really a genuine stimulus and

**24:31** it really just dis shuffling reshuffling

**24:33** the deck uh it's not doing very much

**24:35** about solving these these underlying

**24:37** debt problems uh or is it going to be

**24:40** monetized by the Banks which I rather

**24:42** think it is because that's the solution

**24:43** to debt problems everywhere and it's you

**24:45** know it's been uh you know well it's

**24:48** well trodden ground through history this

**24:50** is how you get out of U major major debt

**24:53** uh debacles China's got to follow that

**24:55** same route um effectively what they need

**24:57** to do is to get the banks to buy

**25:00** government debt that will first of all

**25:02** improve the debt quality or the asset

**25:04** quality rather in Banks balance sheets

**25:06** because they've got a lot of rubbishy

**25:08** real estate debt that is probably

**25:10** completely worthless so having more

**25:12** government debt there at least improves

**25:13** the quality and if the banks do that

**25:16** they can expand their balance sheets and

**25:17** effectively monetize the overall problem

**25:20** but that does mean um you know two

**25:23** things one is that the banks will have

**25:25** to have a bigger Capital base in order

**25:27** to do that to expand their balance

**25:29** sheets well hey the Chinese have

**25:30** actually already agreed to do that so we

**25:33** think that that is likely coming and

**25:35** then the other the other factor is that

**25:37** the cost would likely be uh a weaker

**25:41** Yuan exchange rate uh and that's

**25:43** something which may anyway be inevitable

**25:46** given the Tariff policies that Trump is

**25:50** threatening I'm also thinking about the

**25:53** grand the grander scheme of things

**25:55** though if China would would adopt a

**25:59** more aggressive liquidity policy with a

**26:01** lot more money printing slashing rates

**26:03** and other liquidity incentives but it's

**26:05** against stuff that way over my smooth

**26:07** brain but could their actions on the

**26:09** national level

**26:11** offset any liquidity tightening we see

**26:14** in the west I if that were to happen I

**26:16** understand that's not your case but um I

**26:19** mean yeah could could they kind of

**26:21** change the situation on a global level

**26:23** by doing stuff on the national

**26:25** level yes I mean they they could I mean

**26:27** the the pboc make make no mistake the

**26:30** pboc is the most important Central Bank

**26:32** for when it comes to commodity prices uh

**26:35** I'm not saying specifically gold I'm

**26:36** talking more generally about industrial

**26:38** Commodities simply because China's

**26:40** industrial footprint is so big so if the

**26:42** PB is tightening policy then that's bad

**26:44** news for Commodities if the PBC is

**26:47** easing policy it's extremely positive

**26:49** for Commodities and the tempo of the

**26:51** world economy particular the ocean

**26:52** economies now the Chinese need to get

**26:55** back to easing quite quite quickly uh

**26:57** they basic basically been tightening for

**26:59** some considerable time now which is one

**27:01** of the reasons the world economy is

**27:02** sluggish but you know there is as I say

**27:05** there is evidence that maybe we are

**27:06** moving towards a regime where the

**27:08** Chinese are prepared to ease more

**27:09** aggressively but you know we'll see when

**27:12** it comes to the gold price I think you

**27:14** also got to factor in what the Federal

**27:15** Reserve is doing uh and gold is much

**27:17** more of a well a monetary related uh

**27:20** commodity that has uh you know it gets

**27:23** its traction from what world central

**27:25** banks are doing in terms of monetizing

**27:27** debt and that's a General phenomenon you

**27:29** know um inside and outside China so I

**27:32** think those are the features I think

**27:33** that you know if you if you come back

**27:35** and you say well are we in a world

**27:37** ultimately of tight money or loose money

**27:40** I think in the med in the medium to long

**27:42** term we're in an environment of loose

**27:44** some money because I think that you know

**27:46** the ability of governments to tax uh is

**27:50** is very restricted worldwide um they

**27:53** simply can't do that to the extent that

**27:55** they that they could um there you know

**27:59** is a risk having said that maybe more

**28:01** wealth taxes because that's an easier

**28:03** way of of grabbing tax revenues but

**28:05** that's going to be hugely unpopular so I

**28:08** think they basically have to go down the

**28:09** route of monetization of any spending

**28:11** they do and I think that if you start to

**28:14** extrapolate what could

**28:15** happen in a trump 2

**28:18** regime um I think you could basically

**28:21** see see a situation where you've got

**28:24** increasing tariffs but maybe the analogy

**28:27** is that this is like the British Empire

**28:30** situation in the 1930s of what was

**28:32** called Imperial

**28:33** preference uh and that was basically a

**28:35** tariff regime that uh built a wall

**28:39** around the what was then the Empire so

**28:42** countries like India uh Canada the

**28:45** dominions are in the Australia New

**28:46** Zealand Etc which had very favorable

**28:48** terms or no tariffs with uh Britain but

**28:52** anywhere trading outside of that block

**28:55** uh saw big tariffs now that was deeply

**28:58** deeply unpopular in the us at the time

**29:01** and a lot of us Endeavors through World

**29:03** War II through uh lend Lee and uh

**29:06** whatever else and bailouts for Britain

**29:08** at the end of the war all about

**29:09** dismantling that Imperial preference

**29:11** thing so it wasn't it wasn't a popular

**29:13** move but actually you know the more that

**29:15** one looks a lot of the errors mistakes

**29:19** tactics or whatever that Britain

**29:20** employed as its Empire was in Decline uh

**29:24** you know from the 1920s onwards in the

**29:26** wake of World War I uh the us is going

**29:28** through now uh it's it's doing you know

**29:31** me many of the same reactions uh you

**29:33** know the fisc the the fiscal backdrop is

**29:36** uh is maybe not dis similar um you know

**29:39** uh you've got a lot of mandatory

**29:41** spending Britain had mandatory spending

**29:43** there's defense spending to to take into

**29:45** account and so maybe an imperial

**29:48** preference system like system of tariffs

**29:50** that basically Embrace uh or a wall

**29:54** surrounding us allies is a sensible

**29:57** thing and maybe the condition for being

**30:00** in that group is that there's very

**30:02** favorable policies to the us including

**30:05** uh Europe funding it's taking its fair

**30:07** share of defense spending for example uh

**30:10** things like that so you know all these

**30:12** things are up for grabs but if that

**30:14** occurs then you you're going to have the

**30:16** world very clearly cleaved in two or

**30:19** three different divisions and the

**30:20** Chinese or the brics world is more and

**30:23** more autarchic relative to the West now

**30:27** if you look at what then happened uh

**30:30** drawing using the 1930s as a parallel

**30:33** there was a Scramble for resources

**30:35** because uh resource deployment or res

**30:38** where resources were uh available didn't

**30:40** neatly fit into those economic zones or

**30:43** those tariff uh areas and so there was a

**30:46** scramble to get whatever resources you

**30:48** could and that clearly pushed up the

**30:49** price uh the other thing that happened

**30:52** during those periods when there was a

**30:53** lot of government spending required

**30:55** particularly government initiatives uh

**30:57** on getting access to Commodities and

**30:58** defense and whatever was more and more

**31:00** monetization so you know that would have

**31:03** been you know that's a wonderful

**31:04** background for real assets and it may

**31:07** well be that we're in an environment now

**31:09** where you want to be closer to real

**31:11** assets than financial

**31:14** assets

**31:16** that well the most interesting part

**31:18** about that for me in this specific

**31:21** context uh context of this conversation

**31:24** is that China recently announced that

**31:25** they had stopped buying gold uh but

**31:28** their unpredictable approach to

**31:29** liquidity makes that questionable as

**31:33** well to say the least what do you make

**31:35** of the strategy around diversifying the

**31:37** composition of their reserves partly

**31:39** with gold is that do you expect them to

**31:42** keep doing that because you're saying

**31:43** that's what you want to do you want to

**31:44** stay closer to real assets not Financial

**31:46** assets but on a central bank and

**31:48** National level is that what the bricks

**31:51** block and and China in particular wants

**31:53** to do here well I I I wouldn't

**31:55** necessarily believe what the Chinese are

**31:57** saying but no want by gold uh I mean we

**31:59** we've got to distinguish anywhere

**32:01** between the private sector in uh in

**32:03** China which clearly has a huge appetite

**32:05** for gold and if there is any hint of

**32:09** currency devaluation uh of the Yuan uh

**32:12** the gold the gold market would spike

**32:15** significantly so I think you've got to

**32:17** think about that in itself separate from

**32:20** the fact of what the Chinese government

**32:21** is doing with its reserves and they may

**32:24** well have made that statement to try and

**32:25** cool the gold market so they could get

**32:27** in and buy more at a lower price I mean

**32:29** that I'm sure that's just tactical uh I

**32:31** mean how else are they going to hold

**32:33** their assets I mean China's got a huge

**32:35** Surplus China's great problem is you

**32:37** know it's got an ability to invest

**32:41** globally because they've got surpluses

**32:43** but they've got very few places uh they

**32:45** can put that cash which are not

**32:47** political they can put it in Gold yeah

**32:49** uh okay they can do the belt and Road

**32:51** initiative but that's sort of pretty

**32:52** unattractive at the moment no one really

**32:54** likes that so much um uh they can put it

**32:57** in US treasuries um okay that's deep

**33:00** enough and liquid enough like put it in

**33:02** Swiss Franks but I mean that's such a

**33:04** tiny tiny Market that it's sort of the

**33:06** lunch bill for China um or elsewh I mean

**33:10** where else do they put it they don't

**33:11** want to put it in the Euro because

**33:12** that's this clone of the US and it's

**33:14** probably a flaky uh underlying currency

**33:16** anyway so you've got gold as as the as

**33:21** the main alternative so I think that

**33:23** that's where they're going to push more

**33:24** of their resources and then I think you

**33:26** know the other thing to say is that you

**33:28** know the easiest way for

**33:30** China if I was a Chinese strategist the

**33:33** easiest way of destabilizing the western

**33:35** system would be to encourage all your

**33:38** bricks colleagues to start buying gold

**33:42** um I mean that that would be the obvious

**33:43** thing because then you're starting to

**33:44** threaten the Integrity of the dollar

**33:47** system uh gold is your Challenger and

**33:51** the next thing China would do is then to

**33:53** start military spending and you know

**33:55** China has the ability to do that because

**33:57** he's got more fiscal space than many a

**34:00** lot of Western countries that military

**34:02** buildup can be completely unspecific uh

**34:05** it's just a general buildup the US has

**34:08** got to match that surely NATO has got to

**34:10** match that and who's going to pay for

**34:11** that that's going to wreck fiscal

**34:13** finances and the only way you can pay

**34:15** for it is monetization so therefore you

**34:17** start to weaken paper units against gold

**34:20** and so the gold market I mean I can't

**34:23** you C to me is it's almost a no-brainer

**34:26** it's got to go up

**34:28** H how do I know you're not a Chinese

**34:30** strategist

**34:32** Michael well I don't know just take a

**34:34** look I can assure you I'm not uh

**34:37** considering that silver is more volatile

**34:39** and and economically sensitive than

**34:41** sensitive than gold though and jokes

**34:43** aside here do you think silver could

**34:46** silver could still perform well in an

**34:48** environment of of higher liquidity out

**34:51** there but maybe more economic and debt

**34:54** challenges or does it risk

**34:56** underperformance compared to gold ones

**34:58** again well I mean the thing is with

**35:00** silver there are more moving parts and

**35:02** it's always it's always been called the

**35:04** Restless metal uh and that really

**35:06** explains I suppose a lot of the backdrop

**35:08** of Silvera uh you know silver can spur

**35:10** ahead or fall back significantly around

**35:12** the rising Trend uh because it's an

**35:15** industrial meod it's more speculative

**35:17** you've seen big bubbles in silver it's a

**35:19** thinner Market Etc why I just keep it

**35:22** simple why don't just go for gold I mean

**35:23** that seems to be a pretty decent thing

**35:25** to buy uh I mean you may you make more

**35:28** money in silver in the short term but at

**35:30** the end of the day what you want is

**35:31** monetary inflation Hedges and gold is a

**35:33** pretty decent one I mean B all means you

**35:35** invest in Bitcoin that seems to be a

**35:36** pretty sensible monetary inflation hedge

**35:38** you know diversity I put money into

**35:40** silver too but I mean the point is that

**35:43** you want precious metals and other

**35:45** monetary inflation Hedges because we're

**35:47** in a world of high debt and the only way

**35:49** that you can get this debt down is to

**35:51** monetize it simple as

**35:54** that is that not true for for almost all

**35:57** Commodities that have either an

**35:59** industrial side to the demand profiles

**36:01** or or the ones that are full-blown

**36:02** industrially driven like copper for

**36:05** example well I mean the way the way that

**36:07** I tend to think about this is to say

**36:08** that you know if you look at if you look

**36:10** at industrial Commodities they've got

**36:11** two moving Parts they've got a currency

**36:14** of denomination effect which is let's

**36:17** call that the dollar gold price and then

**36:19** you've got a real exchange ratio which

**36:21** may be the copper to gold ratio or the

**36:25** oil to gold ratio and those are

**36:27** basically real economic relationships

**36:29** that tell us much more about the state

**36:32** of the industrial economy the efficiency

**36:33** of Supply or whatever um those are those

**36:36** sort of factors so you think about those

**36:38** two moving Parts if you get monetary

**36:40** inflation the gold price will go up uh

**36:43** in dollars or Yen or Euros or whatever

**36:46** that's that's for sure uh and assuming

**36:48** those real exchange ratios for the

**36:50** various Commodities stay unchanged then

**36:53** you also got uh a similar increase in in

**36:56** industrial prices to what Gold's doing

**36:59** if you get uh a boost in those real

**37:02** exchange ratios because the economic

**37:04** cycle is picking up or they local Supply

**37:06** difficulties or whatever then you're

**37:07** going to make more money in those

**37:08** Commodities but then equally you could

**37:10** go the other way you get recessions or

**37:12** you get you know excess periods of

**37:14** excess Supply or whatever I would you

**37:16** know I would tend to think that if

**37:17** you're looking forward you've got uh

**37:19** both monetary debasement going on and

**37:22** you've got a prospective shortage of a

**37:24** number of selective Commodities not

**37:26** least because uh you know the various

**37:28** political interests are trying to grab

**37:30** them as easily as they can or as fast as

**37:32** they can and that clearly is what

**37:34** China's doing with um you know a lot of

**37:35** sensitive

**37:37** Minerals Well I was thinking

**37:38** specifically about coer but but the rare

**37:40** are may be interesting too so so again

**37:43** for other industrial Commodities like

**37:45** copper could we expect greater demand

**37:47** pressures if the pb's policy and

**37:49** consistencies continue potentially

**37:52** creating supply issues in

**37:55** China yeah I I would have say I mean at

**37:57** the end of the day look the whole the uh

**38:00** the Integrity of the Chinese system

**38:01** really depends on uh on Rising incomes

**38:04** for the Chinese population um and you

**38:08** know what they what they can't afford is

**38:10** serious setbacks um and if you know they

**38:14** have to create growth and so the Chinese

**38:17** model is basically all about expanding

**38:19** Supply uh if the West is not going to

**38:21** come up with a cash flow to buy those

**38:23** goods then they have to use more and

**38:25** more debt to keep the thing rolling but

**38:27** the problem they've got themselves into

**38:29** so you know the the way they get

**38:31** breathing space is to monetize the huge

**38:33** debt burden they've got at the moment

**38:34** and then start again um but you know

**38:37** everything here points towards higher

**38:38** inflation and I think that you know the

**38:41** the question to ask I me everyone's got

**38:42** to ask personally I mean I ask this all

**38:44** the time what's my personal inflation

**38:46** rate sure ain't 2% I mean see strikes me

**38:49** that it's you know much more in double

**38:50** figures and I'm sure I'm not alone so

**38:52** you know the reality is we've got a lot

**38:54** of inflation anyway but the metrics that

**38:57** govern governments forced down our

**38:58** throats these cpis or core cpis don't

**39:01** adequately reflect them um you know the

**39:03** fact that you know you've got stocks you

**39:05** know soaring you've got the gold price

**39:06** soaring these are all evidence this is

**39:08** all evidence of monetary inflation going

**39:11** on this might be a good point to

**39:13** actually do talk about those bonds

**39:15** because with bond market volatility

**39:17** spiking to what you call a 20mon high as

**39:20** you recently wrote about could we see

**39:22** increased interest in gold and silver as

**39:24** stability Hedges to not only the

**39:26** inflation that talking about but also

**39:28** this volatility or is there a Lisk a

**39:31** risk that liquidity constraints at least

**39:34** over the short run might weigh on the

**39:35** prices of gold and silver well I think

**39:38** the answer is why not they they are you

**39:40** know they're pretty decent safe assets

**39:42** and I mean the question you've got to

**39:43** asked more and more is are um uh our

**39:46** government bonds really safe assets on a

**39:48** higher inflation environment and then in

**39:51** environment where Regulators are

**39:53** increasingly pushing Banks and other

**39:55** financial institutions to hold

**39:58** government bonds as a must have uh they

**40:00** they've got to have them right um that

**40:03** doesn't necessarily mean they're safe

**40:04** anymore May means that may mean they're

**40:06** necessary uh but these are sort of

**40:08** they're becoming forced buyers of these

**40:10** things so I would say that gold and

**40:12** precious metals are pretty decent uh

**40:15** inflation or you know safe assets and

**40:18** decent long-term inflation Hedges now to

**40:21** come back to the point about what

**40:22** happens in a liquidity crisis when a

**40:24** liquidity crisis you sell what you can

**40:26** and not surpris surprisingly

**40:28** particularly if you go back to 2008 the

**40:30** gold price fell because gold was a

**40:32** liquid asset that you could liquidate

**40:34** pretty quickly right um so people sold

**40:36** it now did the gold price stay down no

**40:39** it didn't it rebounded again um you know

**40:41** once the crisis was over and I think

**40:43** that's the way to think about this you

**40:45** know during crisis these things can be

**40:47** highly volatile but you want to be

**40:49** buying them not selling them during the

**40:51** crisis because they're going to come up

**40:52** the other side because the only solution

**40:54** to these refinancing crisis is more

**40:56** liquidity

**40:58** uh you know that that's what we've seen

**41:00** time and time again uh if that doesn't

**41:02** happen the system defaults and you know

**41:04** we have no more financial system no more

**41:06** economy you know whatever the lights go

**41:08** out now that ain't going to happen

**41:10** because policy makers won't let it

**41:12** happen so they're going to PT as much

**41:14** money as they can into the system to

**41:15** keep it running um and the gold price

**41:18** goes up well in actual fact I'm wrong

**41:20** here the gold price doesn't go up the

**41:21** gold price actually in reality

**41:23** technically stays where it is gold is

**41:25** the pole star in the financial Sky it's

**41:28** everything else that basically devalues

**41:30** against gold uh and that's really the

**41:32** way to think about it more

**41:34** correctly yes

**41:36** um one of my friends Lo calls it the

**41:39** dollar to gold exchange ratio and in an

**41:42** exchange ratio um if the price of gold

**41:44** goes up then one of those is either

**41:46** going up or the other one is going down

**41:47** and in this case it's the dollar going

**41:49** down but we each just sit there Michael

**41:51** might be an interesting uh point to go

**41:54** into as well because with higher

**41:56** volatility in bond yields how do central

**41:58** banks balance the need to keep borrowing

**42:02** costs manageable while also avoiding

**42:05** excessive liquidity that could feel not

**42:07** only the inflation that we're talking

**42:09** about here but also

**42:12** hyperinflation well we're not we're not

**42:14** in the realm of hyperinflation yet and I

**42:16** think that you know what you've got to

**42:17** see for to get hyperinflation is

**42:21** radically and I mean radically higher

**42:24** rates of monetary expansion and we're

**42:26** clearly not seeing that

**42:27** so I don't think there's a chance of

**42:29** anything like that uh that's a that's

**42:31** another step uh you know another step U

**42:34** but we are seeing you know naggingly

**42:36** high levels of INF higher levels of

**42:38** inflation and you know think of it this

**42:40** way I me if I'm correct that uh if you

**42:43** look at the US Treasury Market take the

**42:44** US Treasury Market is yields are

**42:47** suppressed by maybe 100 basis points at

**42:49** long in through the way the treasury is

**42:51** issued or uh Coral the market um

**42:55** cleverly Coral the market then the break

**42:57** even inflation rate from the tips Market

**43:00** is about 100 120 basis points higher

**43:04** than current readings so that would say

**43:06** that actually uh 5ye fiveyear inflation

**43:09** is probably nearer three and a bit

**43:12** percent than the 2% Central bank's claim

**43:16** now that's not you know that's not that

**43:18** bad but you know hey it makes a

**43:21** difference uh because it means that your

**43:23** real returns are clearly going to be

**43:24** eaten into it also by the way happens to

**43:27** explain why you've got uh the yield

**43:30** curve as a really poor economic

**43:32** indicator of late because if you add a

**43:35** 100 basis points back to the long end of

**43:37** the market the yield curve never

**43:38** inverted and never signal recession uh

**43:41** it was basically signaling a flat to

**43:43** slightly upward slope curve which is

**43:45** probably telling us about slow growth uh

**43:48** not recession so I think the lot of

**43:50** things become explicable or more

**43:52** understandable if you realize that the

**43:55** treasury and the Federal Reserve in

**43:58** cahoots to suppress yields uh across the

**44:00** curve they're doing yield curve control

**44:02** but they're not fessing up to it it's an

**44:04** unconventional yield curve control but

**44:06** hey it's still yield curve control my my

**44:09** book I mean if you want evidence of that

**44:11** just look at the extremely WID spread

**44:14** that you've got unusually widespread

**44:15** between us treasuries and mortgage

**44:19** agency mortgages in the US I mean that

**44:21** very high um spread is indicative of the

**44:25** fact that the uh the bond market the

**44:28** treasury bond market has been yields

**44:29** have been pushed

**44:31** down but but could persistent bond

**44:34** market volatility pressure the fed or

**44:36** other central banks to to implement you

**44:39** know more obvious or bigger as you call

**44:42** it unconventional monetary policies like

**44:44** like just more aggressive yield curve

**44:46** controls and and what is that going to

**44:48** mean for

**44:49** Commodities well I think it depends what

**44:52** you know what you're already talking

**44:53** about explicitly I mean I think that you

**44:55** know what they could What could they

**44:57** really do I mean they could get I mean

**45:00** if you start to run through the sort of

**45:01** the the gamut of things they could do

**45:03** they could basically say well okay let's

**45:05** get the Federal Reserve to start buying

**45:07** more government debt again okay um now

**45:11** um in other words restarting QE now the

**45:14** question is that that that's a

**45:16** double-edged sword so in the short term

**45:18** what that does is it reduces duration

**45:21** available in the system so it reduces

**45:23** the supply of coupon debt in the in the

**45:26** market and therefore you're going to get

**45:27** a scarcity effect which will clearly

**45:30** pull down yields in the short term but

**45:32** you're simultaneously expanding the

**45:34** balance sheet you're pushing more and

**45:36** more liquidity into the system you're

**45:38** reducing therefore systemic risk uh in

**45:41** other words about refinancing which

**45:43** means that investors demands for safe

**45:46** assets fall away so at the end of the

**45:48** day you make it a short-term uh boost to

**45:52** bond prices but in the longer term bonds

**45:54** are going to sell off because um fewer

**45:57** people want them so actually by doing

**45:59** that yields rise so that's kind of a

**46:02** difficult one to enact what they've you

**46:04** know this is what I'm trying to say is

**46:06** that you know if you look at what

**46:07** they're doing at the moment their clever

**46:08** tactics have been basically to starve

**46:11** the market of duration in the short term

**46:13** but there's only so far you can use that

**46:15** okay uh they're now running out of

**46:17** they're now running out of Road they're

**46:19** losing their their control of the market

**46:21** and yields are slipping away from them

**46:23** and they're basically moving up and you

**46:25** can see that by looking at a breakdown

**46:27** of the treasury

**46:29** market in terms of

**46:31** risk-free uh you know terminal let say

**46:34** terminal policy rates risk-free uh

**46:36** interest rates policy rates and the term

**46:39** Premier uh in the bond market now those

**46:42** two moving parts make up um 10year

**46:45** yields let say or longer dated debt

**46:48** yields terminal policy rates really uh

**46:52** KY off the momentum of the economy now I

**46:55** don't think the US economy showing any

**46:57** signs of cooling down particularly I

**46:59** think the growth looks to be pretty

**47:01** decent um that's what J pal was saying

**47:04** yesterday he was also alluding in the

**47:06** presser uh to the fact that um you know

**47:09** doing a survey uh as the FED does among

**47:12** major corporations many ma major

**47:14** corporations were pretty upbeat about

**47:17** next year and even indicating that

**47:19** growth could be better so if you got

**47:20** that sort of environment it's pretty

**47:22** unlikely that you're going to get big

**47:23** drops in policy rates uh or certainly is

**47:26** hard to justif

**47:27** and then if you look at the term Premier

**47:30** the term Premier has been skewed

**47:31** downwards by a number of factors one has

**47:34** been historically low volatility another

**47:36** has been uh let's say low inflation

**47:39** uncertainty and a third thing has been

**47:41** the fact that there's been a shortage of

**47:43** coupons for the real reason that the

**47:44** treasury has not been issuing them

**47:46** they've been issuing bills instead now

**47:48** all three of those factors which have

**47:50** suppressed term Premier are unraveling

**47:53** and pushing term Premier up it's ain't a

**47:56** US phenomenon this is this is happening

**47:58** globally uh to bond markets worldwide so

**48:00** turn Premier On The Rise and if you just

**48:03** add those two components uh terminal

**48:05** policy rates and term Premier together

**48:08** you understand that bond yields have

**48:10** only got one way to go and that's

**48:11** upwards except and this is the exception

**48:15** if there is a recession which is

**48:16** forcibly created and if I was a policy

**48:19** adviser to Trump and I'm not I would say

**48:22** now is the time to try and create a

**48:23** recession in the US because now is your

**48:27** opportunity to clear the decks to blame

**48:29** everything on the previous

**48:30** administration to do what the socialist

**48:33** government in the UK did which is

**48:35** basically open the books and say oh look

**48:37** there's a nasty black hole here that no

**48:39** one realized we've got to raise taxes

**48:41** because of those uh those damn

**48:44** conservative conservative government

**48:46** that came before us uh didn't know how

**48:47** to you know do simple math uh and

**48:50** therefore sadly everyone's taxes have

**48:52** got to go up even though we said we'd

**48:53** never do it um now that's given them a

**48:56** coper I mean few people probably believe

**48:58** that uh that story but nonetheless

**49:00** that's what they've argued and uh why

**49:03** couldn't Trump do the same just blame

**49:04** everything on Biden and Camala and so

**49:07** that they just completely lost control

**49:09** uh uh sadly I said I was going to I was

**49:12** going to keep tax cuts going and I was

**49:14** going to boost all the spending but I

**49:16** can't do that now I'm going to have to

**49:18** wait two years before you got everything

**49:20** back in order he creates a recession

**49:22** gets yields down finances a lot of debt

**49:25** longer term and then goes for the

**49:26** spending boost uh and then you know what

**49:29** we have is um you know another

**49:31** Republican Administration in four years

**49:33** time that would be sensible

**49:36** tactically don't they're gonna do

**49:38** it well you said you're not an adviser

**49:41** to China you're not an adviser to Trump

**49:43** either but it seems like you can do both

**49:44** of those jobs uh very well but the uh in

**49:47** the end though Michael how much of this

**49:50** Bond volatility is attributed to Market

**49:52** spec speculation versus fundamental

**49:54** issues like government debt lows or

**49:56** fiscal uncertainty is this just kind of

**49:59** happening or is it engineered that's

**50:01** what I'm after here oh I think the Bond

**50:03** volatility is is really a feature I mean

**50:06** part of it is technical bear in mind

**50:08** because the jump uh part of the jump

**50:11** that we saw in the move index which is

**50:14** the best bellweather of bond volatility

**50:15** in the US uh was about the election and

**50:18** it was because the election was coming

**50:20** into the one month window

**50:21** forward-looking window for options which

**50:24** is how they get their calculation of

**50:26** imply vol

**50:27** so that was that was the election that's

**50:29** coming out and consequently the move

**50:32** index is dropping away but You' got to

**50:33** look at the underlying levels of the

**50:34** move index the move index normally is

**50:37** around 70 and you're now looking at

**50:39** levels well above that and I think that

**50:41** really uh is a is a testament to the

**50:44** fact that the underlying fundamentals of

**50:46** the bond market are deteriorating yields

**50:47** are moving up uh term Premier are

**50:50** pushing them up and the range of bond

**50:54** investors uh is getting narrower narrow

**50:57** and it's now mostly speculative hedge

**50:59** funds so we're doing most of the

**51:00** marginal buying and they they depend on

**51:04** low volatility so this is you know a

**51:06** little bit like a sort of snaky in its

**51:08** tail isn't it uh it's a it's a you know

**51:10** it's a vicious circle uh and if you

**51:12** start to get more volatility what

**51:15** happens is that hedge funds buy less of

**51:17** that basis trade uh that means

**51:19** volatility then pushes up higher uh you

**51:21** get even less uh buying of the operation

**51:24** of the basis trade and then the thing

**51:26** unre travels so the treasury and the FED

**51:28** have really got to keep their eyes on

**51:29** the Move index and keep it down and you

**51:31** know when I was more active in the bond

**51:33** markets a level of 150 on the Move index

**51:36** was sort of uh you know signaling that

**51:38** the uh authorities had completely lost

**51:40** control of the of the treasury market

**51:42** and it was sort of switch the lights out

**51:43** time uh you know we got up to 136 about

**51:46** 3 or 4 days ago on the Move index that's

**51:49** not far from 150 we've come all the way

**51:51** down to about 107 now but nonetheless I

**51:53** mean we're still closer to it than we

**51:56** are

**51:57** at normal levels you know I recently

**51:59** stumbled on um from something you

**52:02** retweeted or reposted reex whatever it's

**52:05** supposed to call it these days uh from

**52:07** George Robertson who uh you have kind of

**52:10** have an ongoing discussion with over

**52:13** over time and um the conversation really

**52:16** got simple uh got interesting when one

**52:18** account it's called YOLO DD um he or she

**52:22** asked them it's a simple question and

**52:24** I'm quoting it's a simple question do

**52:26** you think the fed starving the market of

**52:27** long data treasuries has suppr

**52:29** suppressed their yield unquote and

**52:31** George answered in one word saying

**52:33** nonsense this is where I suppose you

**52:35** guys disagree on the inner workings of

**52:38** of how that control I think you know so

**52:41** par what George is saying I mean what

**52:43** he's saying is that the the treasury

**52:45** market is as I understand it anyway he's

**52:47** the best spokesman is keyed off nominal

**52:49** GDP right so given the fact that

**52:52** issuance doesn't affect nominal GDP um

**52:55** how can that affect the bond market now

**52:57** my view is that uh there are a number of

**52:59** ingredients one is ninal GDP which is

**53:01** affecting demand for bonds but you also

**53:03** got to take into account Supply there

**53:04** are two sides of a market supply and

**53:06** demand and if you increase lots of

**53:08** Supply uh you're clearly going to get um

**53:12** a change in the in the price and yield

**53:14** structure and that's exactly what's

**53:15** happening I mean you can look at it look

**53:17** at it quantitatively doing statistical

**53:19** analysis robust statistical analysis and

**53:21** it's Absol you know as plain as anything

**53:23** that um the skew in Treasure issuance is

**53:26** EXP exped uh a lot of this yield

**53:28** suppression in the market uh not just a

**53:30** recent phenomenon go right back to the

**53:32** 1970s it's not a new feature whenever

**53:34** you start to see uh the calendar being

**53:37** skewed significantly towards one uh

**53:40** Direction long or short dated debt uh

**53:42** you get a change in the in the yield

**53:44** structure uh it affects the term

**53:46** structure not surprising that happens it

**53:48** would be the only Market it would be the

**53:50** only Market in the world where it didn't

**53:51** happen uh where Supply was completely

**53:55** irrelevant yeah that yeah that's exactly

**53:57** what he so under that post he said tell

**53:59** me how can supply of US Treasury set the

**54:01** price of us treasuries that is a fantasy

**54:04** he says and that's I suppose that's

**54:05** exactly where you guys disagree yeah

**54:08** because he's saying that uh essentially

**54:10** he's saying that the treasury curve is

**54:12** the risk-free curve well maybe there's a

**54:14** point on it which is the risk-free curve

**54:16** but um you know he's saying that's

**54:18** priced of nominal GDP I think it is but

**54:21** there's more to it than that H good this

**54:24** is actually a great part that I hadn't

**54:26** planned on but I I saw it sitting on the

**54:29** side of my uh screen here looking at

**54:31** Twitter um but this has been a great

**54:33** great conversation very wide ranging and

**54:35** took a bunch of notes what am I

**54:36** forgetting though to ask you here

**54:38** Michael what what are you paying

**54:39** attention that you think is very

**54:40** important but nobody's talking about

**54:42** well I'm what I'm paying attention to

**54:44** most is what are central banks doing in

**54:46** terms of their liquidity injections and

**54:49** B what is the move index doing what is

**54:52** the you know underlying Integrity of the

**54:53** bond markets and that's what's going to

**54:56** tell me a lot about liquidity um and as

**54:58** far as I can see central banks are

**55:00** tentatively putting money in to markets

**55:04** um you know par what we've said about

**55:06** China and the Federal Reserve uh the ECB

**55:09** is putting liquidity in the boj sort of

**55:12** adding although not the same elac they

**55:14** were earlier on in the year but

**55:16** nonetheless they're doing it um other

**55:18** central banks the smaller central banks

**55:21** are adding liquidity generally central

**55:23** banks are easing so I think all that's

**55:25** good I think the point that disappointed

**55:28** me in the fomc statement on the Press of

**55:32** yesterday was the fact that nothing was

**55:34** said uh about the balance sheet um

**55:38** generally I mean apart from the fact

**55:39** they said they were going to continue

**55:40** what they were doing uh no question was

**55:43** posed uh nor did Jal volunteer any

**55:46** answers in the presser about the balance

**55:48** sheet they're going to have to address

**55:49** that pretty soon because the reverse

**55:51** repo is being sort of bled dry and as

**55:55** Lori Logan who formerly used to run the

**55:58** um the S the um uh the system open

**56:01** market account um she said earlier on

**56:05** this year when the reverse repo has run

**56:07** down that's probably uh the time to stop

**56:10** qt or stop the B the the rollof of debt

**56:13** from from the balance sheet I think

**56:15** that's got to be addressed pretty

**56:16** quickly because we're more or less there

**56:18** and I would suggest that it has to be

**56:20** done in the December uh meeting um given

**56:24** it wasn't done yet yesterday well even

**56:26** if had been done before yesterday

**56:28** Michael I would still be just as much

**56:31** out of my depth as I am now but I I

**56:33** greatly appreciate your time and efforts

**56:35** to walk me through this complex inner

**56:37** Plumbing of our financial system I

**56:39** always feel at least 20% smarter after I

**56:43** I've spoken to Michael so again thank

**56:44** you for sitting down with me and I'm

**56:45** looking forward to talking again

**56:47** sometime after that December meeting

**56:49** it's going to be lots to talk about in

**56:50** the meantime too but I'll let you drop

**56:52** off now though because it is time for me

**56:54** to do some digital traveling again

**56:56** before I can go into the CEO barbecue

**56:59** but of course not before my favorite

**57:02** part of every episode and that is of

**57:04** course of disclaimer right after which I

**57:05** promise I will jump into the Co Barbecue

**57:07** but there is a warning on your screen

**57:09** right now and you are obligated to read

**57:11** that one but you and the other ones that

**57:13** are come after but you're also just

**57:15** better off actually doing it because

**57:17** this is not just some generic disclaimer

**57:19** this is an actual warning that might

**57:21** help you not lose as much money which by

**57:24** the way losing money is the norm should

**57:26** the expectation in this sector that's

**57:28** part of it money is part of it too I am

**57:30** here to make money I make money from the

**57:31** existence of this Channel and

**57:33** specifically from companies paying for

**57:35** the production of their interviews this

**57:38** is what this is now in this episode

**57:40** specifically it is Ridgeline minerals

**57:42** who has paid for the production of their

**57:44** interview and white gold has not but

**57:48** that doesn't mean you should look at

**57:49** this episode any differently or their

**57:51** interview because even the companies are

**57:53** not paying they are likely still seeing

**57:56** their participation in this program as a

**57:58** chance to do some marketing so start by

**58:00** understanding that most company

**58:01** Communications online I'll be at this

**58:03** interview or their presentation or

**58:05** Twitter account their website when you

**58:07** call out when you call up their IR

**58:09** person that is all marketing and

**58:12** although I don't make bio cell

**58:13** recommendations because there is a clear

**58:15** conflict of interest many out there will

**58:18** do not only on YouTube not only in the

**58:20** interviews there's a lot of large

**58:22** Twitter accounts that do that for a

**58:24** living make buy or sell recommendations

**58:27** after taking money from the company and

**58:29** you should be aware of that inant bias

**58:31** that bias unfortunately is not always

**58:33** going to be clearly disclos what

**58:34** everyone out there so it is safer for

**58:36** you that anytime you're consuming

**58:39** whatever type of company specific

**58:41** content Twitter Youtube whatever it

**58:43** might be LinkedIn their website

**58:44** presentation just approach it with a

**58:46** dose of skepticism and treat it as

**58:49** marketing unfortunately none of us are

**58:52** magicians I'm not a magician and that's

**58:54** one thing I know for sure maybe some

**58:56** these people out there are I don't know

**58:57** what they're claiming but the guests

**58:58** here are also not magicians the CEOs

**59:02** they're not magicians so we don't

**59:03** possess any Superior knowledge about

**59:05** what will go up what will go down or

**59:07** what's going to go in circles also

**59:08** unfortunately I try as I may I called

**59:11** this show the CEO barbecue it's meant to

**59:13** grill the CEOs and I say that only half

**59:15** jokingly I mean my goal here is really

**59:17** to have a real conversation with the

**59:19** company and and and get to the essence

**59:21** of every story I won't always be able to

**59:24** catch everything relating to a story

**59:26** and if there are things going if if

**59:28** there are things that are not great with

**59:30** the company I cannot promise you I'm

**59:31** going to catch all of it every time and

**59:34** although you shouldn't tell my wife this

**59:36** I'm not perfect I'm not Flawless matter

**59:38** of fact I still have no idea what I'm

**59:40** doing I don't have a long enough track

**59:41** record to prove to myself that I know

**59:44** what I'm doing this is all to say that

**59:47** you shouldn't blindly trust me or

**59:48** anybody on the internet and you should

**59:50** do your own research if you don't

**59:53** understand it don't do it in addition no

**59:55** guarantee are going to be made here

**59:57** besides that there will be

**59:57** forward-looking statements in these

**59:59** conversations these are conversations

**60:00** that are General and impersonal in

**60:02** nature and there can going to contain

**60:04** hopes for future events that may or may

**60:06** not take place depending on many

**60:07** different factors both within and

**60:09** outside of the company's control be

**60:11** aware of that be aware of the bias that

**60:14** goes online be aware of the inent risk

**60:16** to invest again the increased risk of

**60:18** investing in non-revenue generating

**60:20** companies and please talk to someone who

**60:22** can prove to you that they know what

**60:24** they're talking about and to that they

**60:27** know what they're doing how do they

**60:28** prove that to you well a professional

**60:31** investment adviser is a good example

**60:32** professional investment advisor whose

**60:35** intentions and incentives you understand

**60:37** a professional licensed professional

**60:39** investment advisor who has a good enough

**60:40** and a long enough track record as well

**60:42** as of course in the end do more research

**60:45** use your brain before taking any

**60:46** decisions and you do research not on

**60:48** YouTube not on Twitter not on the chat

**60:50** boards you do that on Setter plus.cc

**60:53** that is a government official website

**60:55** that's where you'll find a company's

**60:56** official finings like the financial

**60:58** statement the management discussion and

**61:00** Analysis that's the mdna and their

**61:02** technical reports as well as their

**61:04** management information circular where

**61:05** you can figure out what the compensation

**61:09** structure is for the management and

**61:11** there's a bunch of other documents there

**61:12** that's where you find their news

**61:13** releases and whatnot that's where you do

**61:16** research if you don't do that you are

**61:18** more likely to lose money there

**61:19** disclaimers on your screen right now

**61:21** again if you don't enjoy losing money

**61:23** read them and be careful out there with

**61:25** all that said though

**61:26** I'm always almost going to shut up here

**61:28** because I'll kick off the seal barbecue

**61:30** portion of today's Real Money Talks

**61:32** Episode by traveling to Nevada once

**61:34** again I seem to be spending quite a lot

**61:36** of time in the Silver State these days

**61:37** so it must be busy down there only this

**61:40** time I'm not actually after silver this

**61:43** time I'm after highgrade gold and maybe

**61:45** even some copper luckily for you I'm not

**61:47** going on this trip alone because I'm I'm

**61:49** not the biggest fan of rattlesnakes and

**61:51** scorpions but who is a fan of those

**61:53** apparently is Chad Peters Chad is of

**61:56** course the CEO of Ridgeline minerals um

**61:59** who's that's an exploration company kind

**62:01** of I I like to think of it as a prospect

**62:03** generator hybrid exploration company my

**62:05** mind and of course Chad's being on

**62:07** Research talks many times over the last

**62:09** couple of months we went through the

**62:10** story in depth um multiple times and

**62:13** there's even a playlist specifically for

**62:15** Ridgeline minerals on the channel where

**62:16** you can go and uh or you can and should

**62:20** really go and listen to our previous

**62:21** conversations but no special 10-minute

**62:24** intro here today because Chad you had

**62:26** two news releases since we last spoke so

**62:28** we have uh enough to talk about here

**62:30** today and both of those news releases

**62:31** were related to Swift with the first one

**62:34** uh starting a very nice move in your

**62:36** share price by the looks of it and and

**62:38** nice volumes too but you were traing at

**62:41** a low of about 15 cents before the news

**62:43** and then on the back of it the price

**62:44** went as high as 23 cents and that was in

**62:47** three or four trading sessions and so

**62:49** it's a 55% Spike despite you announcing

**62:53** a permitting delay that took you back a

**62:54** few months in that news release and then

**62:56** when you actually announced the assay

**62:58** which was uh yesterday so a couple of

**63:00** weeks after that on the 7th the market

**63:03** barely reacted to it despite you having

**63:05** drilled the highest grade intercepts

**63:06** though it is I understand it is red or

**63:08** narrow but it is still 10.4 grams of

**63:11** gold over 1.1 meter and that's within

**63:13** somewhat of a larger intercept of 2.7

**63:15** meters grading seven grams so what's

**63:19** going on here what have you discovered

**63:21** what's this Market reaction yeah you

**63:23** know it's kind of it's it's funny you

**63:24** don't get to pick you know always when

**63:26** you put out your press releases like the

**63:27** market that you're putting your press

**63:28** release into right so uh when we put out

**63:31** our our update in October um I think we

**63:33** were touching on $2,800 gold everybody

**63:36** was kind of getting a little bit crazy

**63:37** about gold stocks and so we put out news

**63:38** just simply saying hey permitting has

**63:40** been delayed but we did finish our first

**63:42** program um and assay are pending and we

**63:44** like what we're seeing it was literally

**63:46** the messaging and we went up like you

**63:48** said almost

**63:49** 50% um you know and then we uh we put

**63:51** out the results yesterday which you know

**63:53** I'm very excited about so you're right

**63:55** you you won't parot your uh your assays

**63:57** there but it's it's a very significant

**64:00** um press release for us right like 2.7

**64:02** MERS of s g is very comparable to other

**64:05** the operating head grade of all of the

**64:07** combined mines in the Cortez District

**64:09** which are owned by Nevada gold mines so

**64:10** there's about 50 million ounces of

**64:13** historic production current reserves in

**64:16** the Cortez Trend across about call it

**64:18** let's just call it five mines you know

**64:20** underground mines that are kind of all

**64:21** cobbled together the average grade of

**64:23** those of the current uh P&P reserves is

**64:26** 7.3 G per ton so this is a very material

**64:30** intercept and NGM thinks it is as well

**64:33** baraty just inserted it into their uh um

**64:36** Q3 uh results presentation in mdna as as

**64:39** a significant um high-grade intercept um

**64:43** and you know they included a table in

**64:44** their appendix and the whole thing so

**64:46** Swift is certainly being elevated um in

**64:48** the call it the priority uh level within

**64:51** baric internally um we're really excited

**64:54** about what we're seeing and this is kind

**64:55** of this is how discoveries start I mean

**64:57** I've been a part of multiple discoveries

**64:58** in my career typically you don't just

**65:00** slam into the heart of the the heart of

**65:02** the Zone in your first or second hole

**65:04** right it takes persistence good geology

**65:06** and that's exactly what the NGM team is

**65:08** doing by vectoring in on these higher

**65:09** grades this is the first step and what I

**65:11** think is a much bigger development for

**65:13** this project and I think we're heading

**65:14** towards the discovery so this one meter

**65:17** 1.1 meter intercept how how do you know

**65:20** it it's not just I don't know a teaser

**65:23** or high-grade pocket that occurs in I

**65:26** how do you know well so if we' have

**65:27** drilled this let's just say this was the

**65:29** first hole of the of ever being drilled

**65:31** in this area right of course we'd be

**65:32** excited to be hitting high grade in our

**65:34** first hole but it would be tough to be

**65:36** able to say well we think you know we

**65:38** think that this is part of a larger Zone

**65:39** and here's why because there wouldn't be

**65:40** much detail to support it thing is is

**65:42** we've drilled five framework drill holes

**65:45** in this General Target area over the

**65:46** last three years all of them have hit um

**65:49** wide intercepts of lowgrade gold um in

**65:52** the exact same host truck so we just hit

**65:53** this high grade more discreet interval

**65:55** in

**65:56** so there's a major thrust fall called

**65:58** the mil Creek thrust that is

**65:59** underpinning this entire Target area and

**66:02** every time that you get the favorable

**66:03** host rocks um intersecting the mil Creek

**66:06** thrust or directly above the mil Creek

**66:08** thrust with other cross cutting

**66:10** structures is when you get these blowout

**66:11** zones and that's exactly what this was

**66:13** this was a discrete structural blowout

**66:15** Zone that um is you know in the right

**66:18** host rocks is you know in the right

**66:20** vicinity of this Milk Creek thrust

**66:22** problem is is the milk Creek thrust was

**66:23** actually higher in the in the drill hole

**66:25** hit it higher or shallower than we

**66:27** expected to so what means that means is

**66:29** we only tested about half of the target

**66:30** Horizon so we should have tested over

**66:32** 1,000 fet of host rocks instead we only

**66:34** got to look at about 400 fet of host

**66:36** Rock before that fault sliced it off so

**66:39** where we're going next with this whole

**66:41** seven it maybe to some folks it seems

**66:43** like a large step out being a kilometer

**66:45** away but we're actually stepping to the

**66:47** West um directly down the projection of

**66:50** that known mil Creek thrust and we're

**66:51** drilling right beside whole 3 which was

**66:54** 52 M of point4 or five gold in the right

**66:57** same host rocks but maybe not quite

**66:59** close enough to that big structural

**67:01** blowout that we Now understand is is

**67:03** controlling mineralization so um whole s

**67:05** is a very important hole it's going to

**67:07** tell us a lot more information about how

**67:09** this mil Creek thrust is mineralizing

**67:11** but um but yeah I mean 1.1 meters of

**67:14** 10.4 grams um is great that's the first

**67:16** time we've ever hit high grade on this

**67:19** project you know this is the kind of

**67:20** grade you need to have a significant

**67:22** Discovery at depth in the Cortez Trend

**67:25** uh now that being said the next step is

**67:27** can we find that intersection where

**67:29** those 40 meter zones of low grade get

**67:31** turned into 40 meters of 8 nine 10 grams

**67:34** per ton and that's just a matter of

**67:36** actually just time and good geology of

**67:38** vectoring in and and getting into those

**67:40** high-grade structural zones and I think

**67:41** for me this hole gives me the confidence

**67:44** that that's more of just a matter of

**67:45** time now it's not a if we're going to

**67:47** hit that I truly think we're onto a

**67:49** discovery here it is going to take time

**67:51** to just continue drilling holes finding

**67:53** the right kind of sweet spot and when we

**67:55** do I think it'll really

**67:57** matter Lo of things to touch upon there

**68:00** I want to talk about um essentially that

**68:03** thrust coming up at a different spot

**68:05** where you'd expected it and also the

**68:06** next steps uh it's also something we're

**68:08** going to talk about before that though

**68:10** just you talked about proposed

**68:12** structural traps along the mil Creek

**68:14** thrust too so having seen that first

**68:16** hole which apparently again the grade's

**68:19** there but it also continues to show

**68:20** evidence of the Carin type gold system

**68:22** how confident are you now that the high

**68:24** grade is Rel ated to these proposed

**68:27** structural traps here yeah pretty we we

**68:30** have a pretty high degree of confidence

**68:31** that um you know obviously you have to

**68:33** have the right host Rock if you don't

**68:34** have a you know an iron-rich Limestone

**68:37** you know very permeable host Rock you're

**68:39** not going to get the fluids flowing out

**68:40** into the surrounding rocks so that's

**68:42** step number one you got to have the

**68:43** Rocks we know we have that um but these

**68:45** discrete structures these cross cutting

**68:47** uh structural zones where they intersect

**68:49** the mil Creek that's where you're

**68:50** getting this massive blowout of fluid

**68:52** flow and then when that hits the right

**68:54** host rocks that's how it mineralizes and

**68:55** creates the deposits we're getting um

**68:57** you know call it before this drill hole

**68:59** we knew that was an important component

**69:01** of the expiration story um this really

**69:03** solidifies that okay yeah these cross

**69:05** cutting zones these faults they're

**69:07** they're the key piece to the

**69:08** mineralizing story and so we hit one of

**69:11** those in hole six and now we're stepping

**69:12** a kilometer away to another hole near

**69:14** hole three um and that hole also had one

**69:17** of those big structures cutting through

**69:18** it right at the mil Creek thrust so now

**69:20** we have a higher degree of confidence in

**69:22** how we target that uh the right host

**69:24** trucks and you know it's pretty much a

**69:26** matter of just everything coming

**69:27** together at the right Point um and when

**69:30** they do you end up with a you know a

**69:32** discovery and I think we're on our way

**69:33** to that well you do mention here though

**69:35** that the high-grade Zone was found

**69:37** within a discrete fault structure that's

**69:39** what you call it does this is this

**69:41** telling you anything about continuity

**69:43** like why is it discreet what does that

**69:44** mean uh so I think what we're trying to

**69:46** point out is you know the mil Creek

**69:48** fault is a very throughgoing structure

**69:50** the thrust is a very throughgoing

**69:51** structure that cuts across the entire

**69:53** Target area um the fault that the

**69:55** structure that we hit in whole six it

**69:57** sits D you know it's it's cutting

**69:59** directly across the mil Creek thrust so

**70:01** it's a cross cutting Vault zone so it's

**70:03** and when they say discret we just mean

**70:05** it's it's one of the secondary

**70:06** structures that is cutting through and

**70:08** creating per paracity permeability and

**70:11** fluid flow in the deposit um and so we

**70:13** want to hit these it's critical to hit

**70:15** these discrete zones where they're

**70:17** intersecting that througho mil Creek

**70:19** thrust and when you get that that's when

**70:21** you get your big

**70:22** Zone that's also again reminding me to

**70:24** go back to what I just s of what you

**70:26** just pointed out that I wanted to ask

**70:28** about but there was a if I understand

**70:30** correctly kind of

**70:31** um you didn't hit what you were

**70:34** expecting to hit I suppose um from from

**70:36** the structural perspective which just

**70:38** proves that these things are

**70:38** structurally just not easy but you

**70:41** essentially it's you missed the part of

**70:43** the hansome creek and the slope faes

**70:45** Limestone sections due to what you call

**70:47** higher than expected mil Creek thrust

**70:50** yeah so that's exactly what we said

**70:52** that's what I wrote down actually just

**70:53** taking it over from the news release

**70:56** um does that mean there's

**70:58** something wrong with the with the way

**71:00** you understand a geological motto or

**71:02** like what does that mean where is this

**71:04** coming from no not at all I mean there's

**71:06** just so much structural complexity in

**71:08** these things right like you're really

**71:09** we're we're targeting blind targets

**71:11** beneath um you know over 500 meters of

**71:14** just dead cover right so you don't get

**71:16** to see that structure at surface though

**71:18** you know see what you have to do is you

**71:19** have to drill it take structural

**71:20** measurements on it you know drill

**71:22** another hole a kilometer away see where

**71:24** you hit it start drawing lines between

**71:26** right now the thing is is there's

**71:27** obviously lots of complexity between

**71:29** those you know so we those we initially

**71:31** drilled uh two whole two and three

**71:33** they're about 800 meters apart so we had

**71:35** a a a hit point on the mil Creek thrust

**71:38** in hole three where we had Roberts

**71:40** Mountain Hansen Creek and the slope faes

**71:42** all preserved and then we had a hit

**71:44** point on ho two where we only had the

**71:46** Roberts mountain and a bit of the Hansen

**71:48** Creek preserved so we drilled back

**71:50** between the two closer to two than to

**71:52** three um and we got a little deeper into

**71:55** the section but you know the fault ended

**71:57** up being higher than we anticipated so

**71:58** now we have you know one more Anchor

**72:00** Point we drill whole seven that's you

**72:02** know we're projecting The Milk Creek

**72:03** thrust um to where we think we're going

**72:05** to hit there um if we hit great um if

**72:07** it's higher or lower than we expected

**72:09** then you have to adjust your model right

**72:10** it's it's very much an iterative process

**72:12** so that's why the framework um approach

**72:14** is so important with baric is is you

**72:16** know we're looking for these big

**72:18** structures and it's critical to

**72:19** understand how this thing is projecting

**72:21** across the target area because the

**72:23** target itself is 2 km wide and 3 and a

**72:26** half 4 km long this is a big search

**72:28** space right so once we understand how

**72:31** it's um as we Vector in on the on these

**72:33** zones as we understand how that fault is

**72:35** propagating through we can then start

**72:37** projecting into other structural targets

**72:39** both um to the north south um East you

**72:41** know in all directions essentially um

**72:43** and that's when you go in and hopefully

**72:45** start hitting some better zones I thing

**72:47** there's also goes to show that your

**72:50** strategy of of working with NGM here is

**72:54** is the right path to explore for these

**72:56** kind of deposits because if you had to

**72:58** do all this on your own it would cost

**73:00** you way more money how much money is

**73:02** again being spent on all of your

**73:04** projects this year uh so we're seeing

**73:06** four million going in the ground uh most

**73:08** of which is being uh going in the ground

**73:10** at Swift um just on Swift alone they've

**73:12** spent about $8.2 million through the

**73:15** drilling of whole six so think about

**73:17** that for a second like we're a junior

**73:18** company our market cap hit I think $10

**73:20** million um at its lowest um in this

**73:23** spring there's no way I can raise the

**73:25** money to drill these kind of risky holes

**73:28** like for us if I was drilling it Swift

**73:29** right now I have to be Sharp Shooting

**73:31** every single hole hoping just hoping

**73:34** that I hit a high- grade zone right and

**73:36** that we have something that I can then

**73:37** raise money on and get folks excited

**73:38** about that may be exciting in the short

**73:42** term but that doesn't lead to

**73:43** significant discoveries right big

**73:45** discoveries like what we're going for um

**73:47** you need to be methodical about it and

**73:48** that's what partnering with Nevada gold

**73:50** mines has done right they're being slow

**73:52** steady but very calculated and how

**73:54** they're approaching the expiration here

**73:55** and they're taking all the knowledge

**73:57** they've learned across you know over 100

**73:59** million ounces of Discovery in Nevada

**74:01** over the last 40 years and they're

**74:02** applying that knowledge into this

**74:04** project so it's a huge win for us there

**74:07** was a note about the budget though that

**74:08** there's a change in the budget now it's

**74:10** up to um what the first news release

**74:13** said it's up to $3 million why what's

**74:15** the reasoning behind the change uh

**74:17** really tied into that uh permitting

**74:19** DeLay So we were supposed to start

**74:20** drilling in June um that May June that

**74:23** would have allowed us to drill easily

**74:24** four to five hes before the snow started

**74:26** falling um and pushed us out of the

**74:28** project um because even where we're at

**74:29** even though we're in Nevada we get quite

**74:31** a bit of snow at this project so um it's

**74:33** not really drillable between December

**74:35** and let's call it um you know April late

**74:38** April so um because we had to push it

**74:41** out till August we just don't have the

**74:43** time frame to drill those holes in the

**74:44** budget period that we had intended so um

**74:46** that's why the reduction yeah yeah okay

**74:49** the why I'm asking that is because I'm

**74:51** thinking about the so far they've spent

**74:53** uh what about a third 30 7.5% of the

**74:56** minimum $20 million spent um and that's

**74:59** it after what three years of working

**75:01** together do y do you still expect them

**75:04** to are you concerned about this the pace

**75:07** of the spending that we're seeing from

**75:08** NGM and do you expect them to to spend

**75:10** all that money still on time well they

**75:13** certainly um yeah I mean there's a big

**75:15** there's a big balloon payment coming up

**75:17** as far as like they need to by balloon

**75:18** payment I mean a big spending

**75:20** requirement for them that's the wrong

**75:21** word uh but um they need to spend almost

**75:23** $1.5 million by the end of 2026 just to

**75:26** earn a minimum uh 60% interest in the

**75:29** project right so um so yeah I'm not

**75:31** worried about it especially after seeing

**75:33** this hole get drilled like this this

**75:35** this may have been looked over by maybe

**75:37** a lot of the retail crowd as hey you

**75:38** know a meter of 10 grams just doesn't

**75:40** get me fired up um kind of thing but it

**75:43** certainly is exciting for NOA gold mines

**75:44** right they know what this means they

**75:46** know that we're on to something

**75:47** significant um and you know I think that

**75:50** this hole will push them to finish the

**75:52** you know do their spending in within the

**75:54** time frame but if we hadn't have had a

**75:55** drill hole like this yeah I'd be

**75:57** concerned right that's a big spend on a

**75:59** project that hadn't yet yielded an or

**76:00** grade uh intercept so okay well so now

**76:04** I'm starting to better understand why

**76:06** you're more excited about this hole than

**76:09** than what again maybe the retail crowd

**76:11** out there was and and you mentioned or

**76:13** you compare this to some of the mines in

**76:16** the OR all of the mines you said in the

**76:18** courts as district is that how their

**76:21** Discovery started like or or they find I

**76:24** mean how did they start off did they

**76:25** just also have smaller intercepts and

**76:27** then it kind of grew or or how did the

**76:29** discoveries work yeah you know every

**76:31** Project's different but a great analog

**76:32** that's probably the most recent analog

**76:34** in the Cortez District would be the

**76:35** discovery of the Four Mile deposit which

**76:37** is owned 100% by baric right which is

**76:39** the majority owner of and Nevada gold

**76:41** mines as well um it's directly on trend

**76:43** of the gold rush mine but it's deep so

**76:46** um it took them 11 drill holes um 11

**76:49** framework holes to testing to depths of

**76:51** over 1500 meters depths we're talking

**76:53** considerably deeper than what we're at

**76:55** Swift um it took them whole number 11 um

**76:58** they hit 5.8 M of 49.7 G right obviously

**77:03** awesome drill hole if if we'd have

**77:04** drilled that hole with hole six we'd be

**77:06** having a different conversation right

**77:07** now but um but that was 11 holes in

**77:10** we're only six holes in so our Pro I say

**77:13** as far as when you're comparing how are

**77:14** we tracking against the typical kind of

**77:16** framework approach that baric uses to

**77:18** make discoveries we're right on track

**77:19** we're seeing the kind of or grade

**77:21** intercepts that show that the system can

**77:23** produce um ific high- grade results and

**77:26** I hope by whole 11 12 um we're firmly

**77:29** into what would be considered by anybody

**77:31** looking at the project a Bonafide

**77:32** Discovery so yeah I'm I'm really excited

**77:35** um when you look at the Cortez complex

**77:37** uh they essentially lump all of the

**77:38** underground reserves together right so

**77:40** the Cortez underground which has the

**77:41** hansome discovery that they're working

**77:43** on underneath um Gold Rush which is

**77:45** going to be a 400,000 ounce a year

**77:46** producer in the next few years um those

**77:49** all started just like Ridgeline or just

**77:50** like Swift is starting right now right

**77:52** as as an early stage um expiration

**77:54** prospects so um we're excited is any of

**77:57** this changing your drill frequency or

**78:00** spacing or anything else really related

**78:02** to the drilling or this exploration

**78:04** program now that you know where it is

**78:07** and how much it is and how high grade it

**78:09** is yeah certainly um you know just at a

**78:12** high level um it gives us an anchor

**78:14** point that we're going to start really

**78:15** tuning in on right obviously so um I

**78:18** think with future drill programs um we

**78:20** will focus on following up directly on

**78:22** this intercept as well uh down dip of it

**78:25** but um it's still very much in that

**78:27** framework approach that they're they're

**78:28** doing ngm's doing right now so whole 7's

**78:30** a kilometer away um but it's testing the

**78:33** exact same geological concept as what

**78:35** just yielded uh the discovery hit in

**78:37** whole six so um so yeah I think it's

**78:40** it's certainly changed NGM in our

**78:43** opinion of the project from a you know

**78:45** where could the future of the project go

**78:46** we're a lot more excited and bullish on

**78:48** on what the future looks like for Swift

**78:50** but um you know we're still going to

**78:52** keep on plugging away at these framework

**78:53** holes doing it you know it may be slow

**78:56** and steady but it's the right way to do

**78:57** it and so um next year it'll be a big

**78:59** one well now with this uh whole seven

**79:03** essentially you know that it's one

**79:05** kilometer down dip from hole six which

**79:07** we've been talking about today so far

**79:08** but what exactly are you targeting there

**79:11** what are you really hoping to see from

**79:13** um of course from a grade perspective

**79:15** but also from a structural and

**79:16** alteration perspective yeah we're hoping

**79:19** that with this hole what we're going to

**79:20** see is we're going to see the projection

**79:21** of that same mil Creek thrust but it's

**79:24** far enough to the West that now we're

**79:25** preserving all of the uh all of the

**79:28** perspective host rocks so not only are

**79:29** we going to see um a lot of structural

**79:32** complexity especially right along that

**79:33** thrust fault you know like that thrust

**79:35** fault is is moving just an entire like

**79:38** half you know half of Nevada is getting

**79:40** slid along these faults right like it's

**79:41** just massive amounts of rock being moved

**79:44** that creates a lot of tension a lot of

**79:46** fracturing in the Rock a lot of

**79:47** permeability so that kind of rock they

**79:49** call it you know rock prep or ground

**79:51** prep um is what's required to create

**79:53** paracity and permeability for those IDs

**79:54** to flow so that's the kind of structural

**79:56** trap when you get that that ground prep

**79:59** tying in with the right host rocks and

**80:01** then the and then also having those

**80:03** discrete structures that we talked about

**80:04** cutting through which creates secondary

**80:06** permeability which again enriches the

**80:08** the um the mineralization that's what we

**80:11** hope to see with whole 7 that would be

**80:13** the you know best case scenario we drill

**80:16** something more in the lines of of the 30

**80:18** 40 meter intercepts we saw on the nearby

**80:20** hole three but we're seeing in a

**80:22** significantly higher grade because we're

**80:23** hitting the right hose rocks

**80:25** um in the right spot well let us be

**80:28** optimistic here for a second if that

**80:30** high grade scenario happens what does

**80:32** that mean for for Ridgeline as a company

**80:35** I mean where where do you see it placing

**80:37** you how would you personally value a

**80:39** company that does have those intercepts

**80:41** and and and a company that again you're

**80:43** at about what 145 million doll market

**80:45** cap right now what is having those

**80:48** intercepts du to your market cap well it

**80:50** would be it would completely uh rate the

**80:53** company I think in the eyes of the

**80:54** market right I think that um we would go

**80:56** from a you know maybe being viewed more

**80:58** in that hybrid Prospect generator

**81:00** rediscovery um kind of valuation I think

**81:03** we would get bumped into a proper um

**81:05** Discovery and I think you know a good

**81:07** comparison might be like what kerland

**81:08** was able to do at fret you know we have

**81:10** a 25% free carried interest at uh

**81:13** Ridgeline or at the Swift project um

**81:15** kerland was able to have a 20% joint

**81:17** venture interest in that fret Discovery

**81:19** and they're now trading anywhere from

**81:21** you know 90 to 100 plus million dollar

**81:23** market cap on any given day so um that's

**81:26** kind of the direction that I think you

**81:27** know shortterm project could head if a

**81:29** major Discovery was made um but yeah we

**81:31** need to see you know 20 you know 10 20

**81:34** 30 meters of the exact same grade we

**81:35** just drilled but showing that would be

**81:37** the scale and the grade right now we've

**81:39** shown scale with low grade and we've

**81:41** shown some nice high-grade narrow

**81:42** intercepts we need to get that combined

**81:44** right we're seeing both scale and grade

**81:46** in a single intercept and that's where I

**81:48** think it'll it'll be um viewed as a real

**81:51** Discovery Well in in the spirit of

**81:53** fairness

**81:55** what if it's not there the where you

**81:57** hope it is I know nobody wants to think

**81:58** about that but what if where do you take

**82:00** it from there sure well you know the

**82:02** thing is is is um this is a 75 square

**82:05** kilometer project we've really only

**82:07** tested one one of three primary Targets

**82:09** on the project right so this is a

**82:10** massive land position if you were to

**82:12** take our land position and just plop it

**82:14** you know layer it over top of the Cortez

**82:16** complex you'd fit Gold Rush Four Mile

**82:19** and the Cortez mine within the footprint

**82:21** of our land position so just you know

**82:23** you think about that for a second and go

**82:24** okay this isn't the last this isn't the

**82:26** only Target on the project um there's

**82:28** two other great targets that we would

**82:29** love to test that are similar scale um

**82:32** so if this if we were to never drill

**82:34** another great intercept over at

**82:35** Southwest Swift then we' move to mil

**82:37** Creek or we'd move to the goat anline so

**82:40** um so yeah there's there's great

**82:42** expiration potential there and now that

**82:44** we know that we can host high grade

**82:45** there's going to be other great targets

**82:46** to drill how's the exploration program

**82:49** going so far in terms of um being on

**82:52** time on budget anything unexpected

**82:55** we're uh relatively uh on budget U

**82:57** obviously behind because the schedule

**82:59** got adjusted due to permitting so um

**83:01** yeah little little behind schedule but I

**83:03** think we're tracking pretty well on

**83:04** budget okay when do you think you're G

**83:06** to have more results and when when is

**83:08** this going to be when do you think the

**83:10** whole program is going to be completed

**83:11** by yeah whole seven is going to be done

**83:14** by uh end of November take about a month

**83:16** five you know four to four to six weeks

**83:18** depending on on how quick we can get it

**83:19** out after that to the lab so you know

**83:22** we're talking early January for ass

**83:24** result set of seven um and it really

**83:26** comes down to the winter weather right

**83:27** like if uh it does look like Winter's

**83:29** kind of setting in like it's getting

**83:31** pretty serious here uh so I think by the

**83:32** end of the month we're going to be

**83:33** seeing quite a bit of snow and you know

**83:35** that third hole may not may or may not

**83:37** get drilled but that's uh you know

**83:39** that's all right we'll you know it would

**83:40** just come back in the spring and and

**83:42** once the snow melts and go after it

**83:44** again okay so but you're now thinking of

**83:47** partial whole asses or something like

**83:49** that you just want to do it Ho by hole

**83:51** yeah no I won't do uh yeah I think it's

**83:53** gets dangerous when you start going into

**83:55** partial assays so um if there's if

**83:57** there's alteration and mineralization

**83:59** we'll wait till all the assays are

**84:00** through if we have absolutely Stone dead

**84:02** rock that obviously isn't going to grade

**84:04** I don't mind putting results out for for

**84:06** Stuff uh you know that's maybe grading

**84:08** above that or something like we did with

**84:09** this hole but um yeah probably early

**84:12** January you did note actually reminding

**84:14** me of that you did know that the bottom

**84:16** of the hole so the bottom 156 meters of

**84:18** that intercept did not show significant

**84:20** alteration what's that really telling

**84:23** you is that telling you something about

**84:24** the depth of the system or what does

**84:25** that mean in in its entirety uh no

**84:28** really it just came down to we drilled

**84:30** through the Roberts mountain and then

**84:32** and actually had a bit of a fault so we

**84:34** we had a shorter section of Robert's

**84:36** Mountain than we expected and then we

**84:37** dropped into the Hansen Creek Limestone

**84:39** or dollar Stone um and we dropped into

**84:42** the upper section of the Hansen Creek

**84:43** which isn't that great of a host the

**84:45** better host in the Hansen is actually in

**84:46** the lower section where it becomes more

**84:48** more carbonaceous or like Limestone um

**84:51** and that got faulted off by the mil

**84:52** Creek thrust so it just came down to you

**84:54** know the bottom 150 M they were not

**84:56** visually exciting they weren't

**84:58** geochemically exciting uh when you look

**84:59** at the xrf and it's mostly a function of

**85:01** just the host rocks right you got to

**85:03** have the right rocks right okay so well

**85:06** I think that about covers it actually

**85:07** when I think about it because I ask you

**85:09** about the timing on seven you tell them

**85:10** about the rest what think what else am I

**85:13** forgetting to ask you that what's

**85:14** important here with this release or with

**85:16** the next coming months anything else

**85:17** that you expecting in the next few

**85:19** months yeah you know I think we covered

**85:21** it in pretty good detail on the Tactical

**85:22** side I think something people like I'd

**85:24** like to point out to folks is you know

**85:26** this has been a slow process for us

**85:27** right like we've been public since 2020

**85:30** we've done now three deals with Majors

**85:31** 60 million bucks and these things take a

**85:33** lot of time to pull off and get the

**85:35** deals done and I really think what's

**85:38** what's people should recognize is is

**85:40** these deals are starting to work like

**85:41** we're starting you know it's gone from

**85:43** okay great it's you know you've signed a

**85:45** deal with a major congrats but is it

**85:48** actually delivering value for your

**85:49** shareholders well this is delivering

**85:50** value right before you know we were

**85:52** drilling low-g grade intercepts and it's

**85:54** like okay maybe this isn't going

**85:55** anywhere um this high grade shows that

**85:58** all right this partnering with project

**85:59** with Pro or major companies to put their

**86:02** money in the ground first um and reduce

**86:04** some of that risk it's working I

**86:06** wouldn't have been able to drill these

**86:07** holes ourself um I wouldn't have been

**86:09** able to drill those holes at Selena

**86:10** which is why I partnered with sou 32 um

**86:13** on the Selena project right so we're

**86:15** we're really I think um getting a lot of

**86:18** really good lottery tickets lined up for

**86:19** our shareholders um they're starting to

**86:21** pay off and um yeah I think people

**86:24** should really start um looking at each

**86:26** of the individual deals on their own

**86:27** Merit and then the bigger kind of story

**86:29** we have coming together as a company and

**86:31** I think it's starting to get really

**86:32** exciting and you're going out to some

**86:35** conferences I believe over the next

**86:36** coming couple of months as well and that

**86:38** that's kind of the story that you're

**86:39** going to be telling there I suppose yeah

**86:41** no for sure that you know hey the bigger

**86:43** models the business model is working and

**86:45** and at the project level we're starting

**86:46** to see discoveries materialized so it

**86:48** matters who are you targeting with these

**86:51** uh conferences I I know you're doing

**86:52** you're going to Europe do you want to

**86:54** EXP expand the shareholder base in

**86:55** Europe or what are you hoping for here

**86:57** yeah we're we're heading to Europe uh we

**86:58** have some really great shareholders

**86:59** already out of Europe so it's it's as

**87:01** much uh you know catching up with with

**87:03** existing shareholders and and answering

**87:05** these exact questions in person uh but

**87:07** we're also really looking to try to you

**87:08** know we love uh working with family

**87:10** offices and small funds out of Europe

**87:12** they tend to have a very uh long-term

**87:14** view of Investments and they I find that

**87:16** they they they look at things from a bit

**87:19** of a different lens you North American

**87:21** investors love them they make up a big

**87:23** part of our shareholder base but there's

**87:24** mostly a shorter term view on

**87:26** investments with North American

**87:27** investing groups and um what we're

**87:30** looking for is people that are going to

**87:31** buy into this story because they see

**87:33** what's happening at Swift but they like

**87:35** the opportunity at Selena they like the

**87:37** opportunity at Black Ridge and they

**87:39** believe that we're going to keep on

**87:40** generating those kind of opportunities

**87:41** and eventually something is going to hit

**87:43** that's very significant so um that's

**87:45** kind of the push in Europe well I'm glad

**87:47** to hear that actually that people my

**87:49** side of the pond have a longer term View

**87:52** and uh yeah Chad I wish you good luck on

**87:54** that trip and hopefully speak soon maybe

**87:56** on the back of that whole s or whatever

**87:58** you want always open for a chat of

**88:00** course always enjoy our conversations

**88:01** I'm letting a drop off now though give

**88:03** you enough time to pack your bags and

**88:06** give me enough time to travel all the

**88:08** way up to the Yukon where I've also been

**88:10** spending quite a lot of time lately

**88:11** actually digitally at least uh

**88:14** unfortunately not physically

**88:15** unfortunately I'm not there to watch the

**88:16** northern lights either I'm mostly there

**88:19** to look for gold and that's exactly what

**88:22** I'm doing here today luckily for

**88:24** everyone listening though I won't be the

**88:25** one doing all the Talking as I'm joined

**88:28** by David denafo the CEO of white gold

**88:30** Corp an exploration company listed as

**88:34** whg F on the OTC in the US as well as

**88:38** WG on the TSX Ventures Exchange in

**88:41** Canada where an average of about 65,000

**88:44** shares trades each day I see a 52- we

**88:47** high of almost 42 cents and a 52- we low

**88:50** of 20 cents there are 176 millon shares

**88:54** outstanding and with today's $46 million

**88:57** market cap that means wgo is trading at

**89:00** about 26 cents per share in addition to

**89:03** the 176 million shares outstanding there

**89:06** are 15.8 million options but do note and

**89:09** to my surprise there's no warrants at

**89:12** all leaving the number of fully diluted

**89:13** shares at about

**89:15** 192 million management here owns 18% of

**89:19** the company and an exact third so that

**89:22** be 33.3% is owned by two of the largest

**89:25** gold mining companies out there with

**89:27** that being AO ego who owns a smidge

**89:29** under 20% and Kinross who owns just over

**89:33** 133% leaving less than 50% in the

**89:36** effective flow consisting of retail and

**89:38** of course a couple of institutions in

**89:39** between as well the last officially

**89:42** filed financial statement on Setter plus

**89:44** which shows the numbers as of June 30

**89:46** 2024 has over $3.2 million in current

**89:50** assets on it mostly in cash and CE so

**89:53** specifically $2.7 million that was at

**89:56** the time recorded as cnce on the balance

**89:59** sheet and there is almost a half a

**90:01** million dollars in prepaid expenses as

**90:03** well as some receivables on top of that

**90:05** as well total liability sat at over $15

**90:08** million mostly in the form of a deferred

**90:10** income tax liability and contingencies

**90:13** relating to the deal with Kinross which

**90:15** by the way the last two together they

**90:17** account for the vast majority of that 15

**90:20** million so they account for over $14

**90:21** million so that with the current life

**90:24** abilities sitting at just about $1.3

**90:26** million in account payables mostly but

**90:29** there's also a bit of a flow through

**90:31** share premium and top of that as well in

**90:33** terms of operating expenses a six-month

**90:35** period that ended on June 30 this year

**90:37** costed white gold a bit over $2 million

**90:39** if you account for everything but if you

**90:41** take out the non-cash expenses like

**90:43** share based compensation and

**90:44** depreciation and in this case some of

**90:46** the contingencies and royalty creation

**90:49** the cost Falls to about $870,000 for the

**90:52** six-month period which is about1

**90:54** $40,000 um in average monthly

**90:57** administrative costs the largest element

**90:59** of that administrative spend is what I

**91:01** would call shareholder communication so

**91:03** it is it can it includes marketing

**91:05** conferences and offices so if you count

**91:07** those three together you're sitting at

**91:08** about

**91:09** $385,000 for the entire period And so

**91:12** representing an average of 44% and an

**91:14** average monthly spend of 65 Grand on

**91:17** those three things as so exploration and

**91:19** evaluation those get capitalized so

**91:22** you'll find them under note five in the

**91:24** financials and they show about $1.5

**91:26** million in Exploration and evaluation

**91:28** spend for the entire six-month period

**91:31** which is an average of

**91:32** $250,000 per month and I don't see a

**91:35** detailed breakdown of those expenses

**91:37** here in the financials but the way the

**91:39** company spends money is hopefully going

**91:41** to become clear later on in the

**91:43** conversation but in summary we've got

**91:45** 145 Grand a month going into

**91:47** administrative costs and

**91:49** $250,000 is going into exploration and

**91:52** evaluation related activities leaving us

**91:54** with an exploration to Administration

**91:56** ratio of about 1.7 to1 meaning about 64%

**92:01** of the money goes into exploration and

**92:03** evaluation related activities and about

**92:05** 36% into Administration as always though

**92:09** please understand that this financial

**92:10** statement is nothing more than a

**92:11** snapshot in time in this case it is

**92:13** specifically at the end of June of this

**92:15** year and it simply shows you what the

**92:17** finances look like on that exact date

**92:19** and nothing more finances though as I

**92:21** like seeing are a fluid thing so it is

**92:23** imperative that by the time you're

**92:24** watching this you visit the company's

**92:26** website as well as set

**92:28** plus.cc dat numbers for yourself and

**92:31** make sure you're getting the full

**92:32** picture for wide gold that full picture

**92:35** is fully focused on the Yukon but it's

**92:37** far from it being just one project

**92:40** actually the company controls over

**92:41** 300,000 hectares of land which is

**92:43** basically half the district but the

**92:46** flagship project that they have shares

**92:47** its name with the corporation so it is

**92:49** white it's the white gold project and it

**92:52** includes four deposits that are close to

**92:54** each other with an over 2 million ounce

**92:56** resource between the four and between

**92:58** the indicated and inferred category of

**92:59** the ni

**93:00** 4311 it split about halfway in each

**93:04** category with average grades of 2.2 for

**93:07** the indicated and one and a half grams

**93:09** per ton of gold for the inferred

**93:10** category and again those are average

**93:13** across the four deposits that the white

**93:15** gold resource is spread between with all

**93:17** four being relatively shallow and thus

**93:19** potentially open pable but the company

**93:22** believes that there is potential depth

**93:24** here as well as well as a long strike by

**93:26** the way so they say that there's more

**93:27** exploration upside although we haven't

**93:29** seen much on that lately so hopefully

**93:32** again I get to ask about that later on

**93:34** in the conversation the company also has

**93:36** multiple early stage discoveries in the

**93:38** Yukon so I won't go over all of them

**93:39** there's basically three groups of

**93:41** projects so we have advanced a little

**93:43** less Advanced and early stage stuff but

**93:45** I'll pick out two which were the focus

**93:47** of the recent exploration Campaign which

**93:49** started in June of this year and that is

**93:52** uh Betty so that one of one of those

**93:54** projects called Betty and the other one

**93:55** is called QV Betty is rather close to

**93:58** New month's coffee gold deposit on one

**94:00** side as well as even closer to the

**94:02** casino power free deposit currently

**94:04** owned by Western copper and gold on the

**94:06** other side it's not yet clear what the

**94:09** deposit type um that white gold is after

**94:12** here at Betty is because the setting

**94:15** allows for the potential presence of

**94:17** multiple different types of deposits

**94:19** including a copper poy it's actually

**94:20** copper Molly gold pory in this case or

**94:23** another intrusion related deposit or

**94:25** perhaps even an epithermal gold and

**94:26** silver system or of course maybe that's

**94:28** always the case I suppose maybe an

**94:30** orogenic gold deposit as well so that

**94:32** already leaves us a few question marks

**94:34** which Again David and I will hopefully

**94:35** get to later on in the conversation QV

**94:38** is the second target as I mentioned

**94:40** that's where in 2023 the company

**94:42** identified a 1 kilometer long golden

**94:45** soil anomaly which is close to one of

**94:47** the deposits making up the white white

**94:49** gold um project resource which this QV

**94:53** Target it seems to look a lot like

**94:55** suggesting a similar style of

**94:57** mineralization now the current

**94:59** exploration program though has actually

**95:00** already more than doubled the strike

**95:02** length at QV of that anomaly so it's

**95:05** about 2.2 km as well as surface Rock

**95:07** sampling has encountered gold associate

**95:09** with with Associated anomalous silver

**95:11** and torium in Altered and mineralizing

**95:14** intrusive rocks over a 1.2 km strike or

**95:18** section of that 2.2 kilometer anomaly so

**95:22** what the company is doing right now is

**95:25** preparing to drill it and hopefully

**95:27** again we'll get more information on it

**95:28** later on again too much land too many

**95:31** targets to go through here in this

**95:33** summary but there sure are more and

**95:35** maybe we touch upon them as well in in

**95:37** the discussion here with David but I'm

**95:39** rushing to shut up already and let you

**95:41** do the talking here David because this

**95:43** is your first time on the CEO barbecue

**95:45** so there's a couple of obligatory first

**95:47** questions that we have to go through

**95:49** with the first one being who are you and

**95:50** why should I trust you with my money

**95:53** well thanks for having me those are that

**95:55** was a wonderful overview one of the more

**95:57** fulsome ones I've it's nice to hear back

**95:59** the story the way that uh information is

**96:02** uh interpreted in the market I think

**96:04** that was a good overview a couple things

**96:06** to clarify there uh so David denofrio

**96:09** CEO of white gold Corp I'm also a

**96:11** principal with power one Capital group

**96:13** based in Toronto we're a merchant

**96:16** bank we're technically sector

**96:19** Diversified but mining expiration has

**96:21** been uh the primary f focus of our

**96:24** business for about 25 years now a

**96:26** Founder is Pat the kappo he's really

**96:29** built for himself and our firm an

**96:32** incredible reputation in the exploration

**96:34** Finance industry and we've been

**96:36** fortunate enough to have been involved

**96:38** with a number of very high-profile

**96:41** success stories uh over the years and

**96:43** from our perspective you know we're

**96:45** principal investors first and we're

**96:47** looking for opportunities to get in

**96:49** early work with teams or work with

**96:51** projects and help build build out teams

**96:53** where we can start from a Grassroots

**96:55** opportunity have expiration success and

**96:58** eventually sell that to a major uh

**97:00** that's our our our goal with all these

**97:02** types of uh companies and Through the

**97:04** Years uh through the success we've

**97:06** really been able to sort of help I would

**97:08** say hone in on a approach that listen

**97:11** it's a risky business there's no

**97:13** doubting that but sort of mitigate the

**97:16** risk to the best extent possible some of

**97:18** the names that some of you and some of

**97:20** your viewers may be familiar with you

**97:22** know starting way back really resources

**97:23** that was a company we took public that's

**97:25** now fruit Del Norte being run by the

**97:27** lundine family obviously a wonderful

**97:29** deposit we sold that to Kinross way back

**97:32** when and uh then we went on to work with

**97:34** uh Patrick Anderson the team to do Daran

**97:37** resources in Ireland another great

**97:40** discovery um that's on the gold side

**97:43** we've been involved in many other

**97:44** minerals lithium for example we actually

**97:46** took lithium America's public as

**97:49** founding investors and partnered to

**97:50** Waldo Perez that's gone on to do

**97:53** tremendous things this was you know so

**97:54** early on 2010 Tesla wasn't even public

**97:57** nobody knew what lithium was for uh but

**97:59** we really do pride ourselves of getting

**98:01** in early on Trends and it's not always

**98:04** the easiest because you know you really

**98:05** have to be able to stick it out but when

**98:07** we believe in uh a sector or a thesis uh

**98:11** you know we put our money where our

**98:12** mouth is and our model is to bring the

**98:15** right pieces of the puzzle together

**98:16** early on so if and when the company does

**98:19** have success they have the Right

**98:20** audience there whether it's other

**98:22** members institutional community provide

**98:23** additional Capital whether it's other

**98:25** members in in The Brokerage Community to

**98:27** be able to provide uh analyst coverage

**98:30** sales trading marketing all those kind

**98:32** of good things and when we do work with

**98:34** good people we're now in a position

**98:36** where we're fortunate enough to to work

**98:38** with them on their second and third

**98:40** projects and and and I think the people

**98:43** as you likely aware are such a big part

**98:45** of the equation here in addition to you

**98:47** know other metrics jurisdiction stuff

**98:48** like that we can talk about and we were

**98:50** fortunate to then go on and work with

**98:52** wal the pre on neolith again which was

**98:54** another great discovery in Argentina

**98:56** that was uh acquired by Zin a few years

**98:59** ago some other examples on the precious

**99:01** metal side you you may be aware of you

**99:04** know very recent stuff um orex resources

**99:07** we partnered with hodon and Alan Freeman

**99:10** probably people you've familiar with

**99:12** that was sold to B2 gold then we

**99:14** partnered with them in Ross Bey uh to

**99:16** start ignal resources and also in India

**99:19** that that was uh vended um them more

**99:22** currently

**99:23** uh were very very involved with another

**99:25** amazing Discovery in Colombia called uh

**99:29** it's a it's well the company's called

**99:32** Collective mining it's run by Ari susman

**99:34** he was the founder and our partner of

**99:36** Continental gold again that was sold so

**99:38** so what I'm going with here is uh you

**99:41** know not to brag there's a lot of ones

**99:42** that don't work out as well it's you

**99:44** know we're at a nice phase where we're

**99:46** working with people now in their second

**99:48** and third projects right so we like the

**99:50** people we like how they work we

**99:52** understand um their uh approach to

**99:56** expiration and it's really helped us

**99:59** mitigate risks and white gold is fitting

**100:01** very much into that uh uh checklist of

**100:06** really sort of um addressing all the

**100:09** factors that we think are the most

**100:11** important when identifying an

**100:13** opportunity and what I mean by that and

**100:16** not every situations the same but we

**100:18** look at stuff like

**100:20** jurisdiction from a obviously geological

**100:24** Potential from support whether it's

**100:26** government support first nation support

**100:28** all these you know different

**100:29** stakeholders very very important um what

**100:32** else is happening in the district you

**100:34** know how explored has it been and you

**100:38** know who else may be interested in that

**100:40** area and from the white gold perspective

**100:43** particularly it's actually a very unique

**100:45** time like you know the Yukon this part

**100:47** of the Yukon uh it's called the kondik

**100:50** District which was the epicenter of the

**100:52** big gold russiaun 25 years ago right

**100:54** we've all seen the pictures people

**100:55** basically risk their entire lives to get

**100:58** to the Yukon with their uh sleuth pens

**101:01** and and and look for riches now they

**101:03** have over the years been an incredible

**101:06** amount of gold that's been found in this

**101:08** area on record it's over 20 million

**101:10** ounces of plaster gold has been mined

**101:12** for this

**101:13** area my guess is probably a lot more

**101:15** than that uh statistically from other

**101:18** areas in the world where we have major

**101:19** plaster discoveries there's usually two

**101:21** to three times more gold in the Hard

**101:24** Rock so what happened how come 125 years

**101:29** ago they found all this gold and nobody

**101:30** went there right that's an interesting

**101:32** question well the first person that we

**101:34** knew of that went there to do the work

**101:36** was a guy by the name of Shawn Ryan he's

**101:38** a prospector he comes from the Tim's

**101:40** camp and he sort of had a perspective of

**101:43** thinking big you know he wanted to look

**101:45** for an opportunity where he could a

**101:48** apply his unique approach to prospecting

**101:51** in an area that when he successful he

**101:54** would be able to really do something big

**101:57** I think in this business you want to be

**101:59** taking your investment and and looking

**102:01** the rewards have to be big right there

**102:03** like I mentioned there's a lot of risk

**102:04** so when it works you want these things

**102:06** to work and by working you know I think

**102:08** at the end game you're looking at it 5

**102:10** 10 20 time multiple on your

**102:13** investment well Sean realized you know

**102:15** he found this area he saw that the

**102:17** history was there he saw there was

**102:18** little work that's been done in modern

**102:20** times modern technology so that was

**102:22** really attractive

**102:24** he went there and what did he find and

**102:26** this is the first question we asked

**102:28** right so we Sean is our partner I'll get

**102:29** a little bit into the history of how

**102:30** that came but what he found was this

**102:32** area of the Yukon was not glaciated like

**102:35** the majority of Canada and a lot of

**102:37** places around the world most Prospectors

**102:39** their tool is out outcrop see the

**102:42** outcrop they take the samples they bring

**102:44** that to the lab that's what they then

**102:45** use there's no outcrop there's only two%

**102:47** of this area the Yukon that shows El

**102:49** crop so how do you look for the gold

**102:52** doesn't fit in most people's Playbook

**102:54** they just didn't bother looking there

**102:56** right it's it's it makes no sense that

**102:58** Alaska you have so much gold BC you have

**103:00** so much gold it's part of the same belt

**103:03** how you know or gold and other medals

**103:05** why is it not there so Sean spent a lot

**103:07** of time doing a lot of research and the

**103:10** tool that he found to be most applicable

**103:13** in this area was soil sampling so he

**103:15** went he developed a protocol use all the

**103:18** most recent Technologies you can find

**103:19** and this is starting in sort of like

**103:21** 200 probably you know four five six did

**103:24** a lot of the early leg work himself to

**103:27** identify what he thought would be

**103:28** mineralized systems or the Hast Stacks

**103:30** as he calls them and from that point he

**103:33** want he would need you know because he

**103:34** needed access to more Capital uh to to

**103:38** Really sort of take the next step which

**103:40** is stuff you know which is Diamond drone

**103:42** right at the end of the day that's going

**103:42** to tell you where the proof is in the

**103:44** pudding and it remarkably his work led

**103:48** to two major discoveries almost

**103:50** immediately the first was the coffee

**103:52** deposit which you mentioned is now owned

**103:54** and and is you know should have actually

**103:57** been in production already if they

**103:58** didn't get bought by goldkart phenomenal

**104:00** discovery that was Sean's uh 4 million

**104:03** ounces at the time if you include the

**104:04** sulfites and the next one was the Golden

**104:07** Saddle which is part of white gold um so

**104:10** remarkably which you know you never see

**104:12** happens you have a guy with a theory go

**104:14** make two major multi-million ounce

**104:15** discoveries back toback within a couple

**104:17** of years in an area that see no work but

**104:20** in an area that's in a phenomenal

**104:22** jurisdiction so Sean in the backs of

**104:25** that came to us at Power one and and

**104:28** what he did smartly and what really

**104:30** excited us and what really excited our

**104:32** major Mining Company Partners was he

**104:34** then went and tied up the district so

**104:36** now we have an area which we everyone

**104:40** has this wonderful prolific history not

**104:44** too much work has been done the little

**104:45** bit of work that got done has remarkably

**104:47** successful and now we had an opportunity

**104:49** to basically own it all so from our

**104:51** perspective that really really was an

**104:53** appealing opportunity to be involved

**104:55** with and you know what our dream was and

**104:58** it's starting to play out is imagine you

**104:59** could go back in time and stake and

**105:03** own the majority of valdor or the

**105:06** Timmons camp or the Nevada goldfields

**105:08** one of these huge huge districts with

**105:11** you know multi- tens of millions ounces

**105:13** of gold and own all one company well

**105:15** that that's you know the best case

**105:18** scenario you could ever dream about and

**105:20** that's what we thought the potential was

**105:21** here and we signed up with Sean we

**105:23** partner with him and on the backs of

**105:26** that we showed it to a few

**105:27** majors and not surprisingly all of them

**105:30** were very interested to partner with us

**105:32** just because of the uniqueness of the

**105:34** opportunity and from that point forward

**105:37** we've continued to do our work and I

**105:39** don't know if you want to jump in with

**105:40** some questions and and start to have the

**105:42** success that we've had over the years

**105:44** with these obviously growing our

**105:47** Flagship deposit now which is about 2.1

**105:49** million ounces in all categories the

**105:51** grade is remarkable just under two grams

**105:53** a ton it's actually the fifth highest

**105:56** grade deposit over 2 million ounces

**105:59** owned by a junior in Canada um and and

**106:03** and then take that and that what we've

**106:05** learned in that success and apply to

**106:07** other areas of the district to go and

**106:08** make new discoveries I do want to dive

**106:10** into what exactly you're doing with that

**106:12** deposit because you have a lot of other

**106:14** things going on at the same time but

**106:16** there's a couple of uh other questions

**106:17** that I have before that I call them my

**106:19** smell test before I actually get to

**106:21** grilling um men and insiders are noted

**106:24** at 18% ownership what percentage of that

**106:26** is you personally David and what's your

**106:28** average cost of

**106:31** capital

**106:33** so I

**106:35** think

**106:38** um me

**106:39** personally I probably have uh about so

**106:44** so the Insiders are basically three

**106:45** groups it's Sean Ryan and it's power one

**106:49** and then within power one there's Pat

**106:50** the kappo and then there's myself and

**106:53** sort of the other guys in the power one

**106:55** group uh myself personally I probably

**106:58** have

**106:59** about maybe two and a half 3% of the

**107:02** company

**107:04** um my average cost is certainly higher

**107:07** than where the share price is today I

**107:09** think I probably personally have a

**107:10** million dollars invested uh in that uh

**107:14** the you know the majority of the balance

**107:16** of that is Pat also you know listen we

**107:17** partic we put our money where our mouth

**107:19** I told you we're a merchant bank uh

**107:21** everything we do we're the largest

**107:22** investor dollarwise um except maybe in

**107:26** this case you know we have major mining

**107:27** companies who have put in more dollars

**107:29** than we have but you know we support it

**107:31** all the way along and you know even if

**107:32** you check your stetic filing I've been

**107:34** buying in the market myself recently up

**107:36** to I in the 40s and why because I

**107:39** believe this is a phenomenal opportunity

**107:41** and when you have a real asset you know

**107:42** this is my Merchant banking power one

**107:44** hat on you got to hang on to it because

**107:46** listen the Cycles come and go areas get

**107:47** hot and cold but the perfect example

**107:49** I'll give you is uranium we have a

**107:51** incredibly you know strong uranium

**107:54** portfolio right now in power one people

**107:56** say oh you guys are so smart how do you

**107:58** time well listen we didn't time it we've

**108:01** owned this portfolio now for 10 years

**108:03** right we had good assets in good places

**108:05** uh you know one particular example is

**108:07** Encore Energy it is now has two

**108:09** facilities or two sites in production in

**108:11** America that company we've owned it for

**108:13** over 10 years now and for the longest

**108:15** time you know there's Fukushima nobody

**108:18** cared about that you couldn't give

**108:20** shares away but the CEO would come in

**108:22** every couple of years listen this is

**108:24** what I need to hold my tenaments and

**108:25** keep the lights on keep my team together

**108:27** and we supported it and we support it

**108:29** support it we had the view that come

**108:31** back fast forward you know it's now New

**108:33** York Stock Exchange listed it's now a

**108:35** billion dollar market cap it's now

**108:37** production so when you have a good asset

**108:39** you know the time will come obviously

**108:41** you want it to come sooner rather than

**108:42** later I think in this gold cycle we've

**108:45** started to see the majors have their

**108:47** move the MERS have their move the

**108:49** Juniors have not moved so that in my

**108:52** mind is the opportunity for the biggest

**108:54** sort of near-term reating potential yeah

**108:57** that's and again I want to talk about

**108:59** how you're going to get there more

**109:00** specifically uh but you bring up a good

**109:02** point and that is that this is not the

**109:04** only company you're involved with uh I

**109:06** also see that you've been buying shares

**109:07** of lithium ionic Corp and I believe you

**109:09** do have other positions like I mean

**109:11** you're active um with the Merchant Bank

**109:14** as you just told me how important is

**109:16** West gold is an investment to you that's

**109:18** what I'm a that's why I'm

**109:20** asking we never were very very very

**109:23** rarely uh

**109:26** take uh management positions usually we

**109:28** have great relationships with the with

**109:29** the CEOs um sometimes we'll go on the

**109:32** board if we think you know like a lot of

**109:35** these Junior companies they don't have

**109:37** the resources to build Out full

**109:39** management teams that they need and and

**109:40** and and our our perspective is we like

**109:42** to keep overhead cost very

**109:45** lean and what happened with the whiteold

**109:47** situation why I'm in the chair as a CEO

**109:49** which is really sort of like the power

**109:52** one team as a as a group kind of in that

**109:55** position Sean Ryan to his credit when he

**109:58** when he came to us the partner he

**110:00** basically he indicated that listen he

**110:02** wanted to focus on doing what he's good

**110:05** at and what he liked which is the

**110:06** technical work he didn't want to you

**110:08** know have the burden of managing the

**110:10** capital markets the accounting the

**110:13** finance CFO all the other stuff that's

**110:15** the responsibility of a CEO in a junior

**110:18** company and that's a very that was a

**110:19** really really excellent suggestion on

**110:21** his part because what does that do it it

**110:23** straps that individual from their time

**110:25** and their capacity and it also forces

**110:27** them sometimes to do stuff that you know

**110:29** is not really their strength so we

**110:31** decided to split what is a normal CEO

**110:34** role into two capacities and so Sean's

**110:37** doing all the technical stuff me the

**110:39** power one group and our network is

**110:41** basically doing everything else and what

**110:43** also that's done is allowed us to really

**110:45** bring down the overhead Sean doesn't

**110:47** take a salary you know us for our entire

**110:50** group takes you know a modest amount

**110:52** which is less than even half of what a

**110:54** normal CEO salary would be and you know

**110:57** you did touch on some of those ratios

**110:59** early on about you know overhead to in

**111:01** the ground uh ratio that was you you

**111:06** wisely point out that's a point in time

**111:07** so the first half of the year you know

**111:09** that's not really uh you know we start

**111:12** our work in the Yukon in June or May

**111:14** right so the first half of the year is

**111:17** basically all corporate overhead

**111:20** salaries type of stuff then the EXP

**111:22** ation expenditures sort of start from

**111:24** June for the Balan half of the year so

**111:26** that that ratio is going to vary if you

**111:28** look at you know look at maybe go back

**111:30** and look at the last few Decembers

**111:31** you'll get a better picture when you're

**111:32** looking at the full 12 months of it so

**111:34** we're very cognizant of keeping um

**111:37** administrative GNA costs down we want as

**111:40** much money going to the ground as

**111:41** possible and between my time Sean's time

**111:45** and our group's time that's you know

**111:47** probably more than You' see a

**111:49** traditional CEO CFO be able to give and

**111:52** you have leverage of an entire team uh

**111:55** doing the work of what's sometimes

**111:56** burden on one

**111:59** individual that's a good point um about

**112:03** you stepping in as a CEO where you

**112:05** typically don't step in would you want

**112:06** to keep the CEO position as the idea for

**112:09** you to remain the CEO

**112:11** until the story has concluded in in

**112:13** whatever way or are you actively looking

**112:16** out for a new

**112:18** cuu you know I I think the the the

**112:21** answer to that question lies and how

**112:23** does the corporate strategy play out

**112:24** here right this company was put together

**112:26** to be a project generator in our view we

**112:29** wanted to go our team score competency

**112:31** is Green Field expiration now we do have

**112:35** a a project that now has grown to have

**112:38** some considerable um uh you know uh Mass

**112:43** to it so now that's not a Greenfield

**112:45** exploration project so what is it that's

**112:47** going to happen with that project how

**112:48** does that um affect you know the

**112:51** corporate management of the of the

**112:52** position I think between myself the team

**112:55** the capacity is there if there was ever

**112:58** a situation where you know there was a

**112:59** better person to be in the chair Than Me

**113:02** by all means right this I'm not have you

**113:04** know any interest like you know

**113:06** unfortunately there's a knock on our

**113:07** industry there's guys that these are

**113:09** lifestyle companies they you know they

**113:10** just want to keep the lights on and keep

**113:12** their corporate credit cards and the

**113:13** conferences and all that kind of stuff

**113:16** from our perspective we're investors

**113:18** first we're fiduciaries to other people

**113:21** that have invested you know along onside

**113:22** of us and our goal is to optimize the

**113:25** value of the company and and more

**113:28** specifically the for the share prices to

**113:31** increase some management teams you know

**113:33** they talk about how market caps have

**113:35** gone up but if share prices are not

**113:37** going up then it's really done no

**113:39** benefit to the investor so that you know

**113:42** that that's our view and from our

**113:44** perspective that that's what we're you

**113:46** know working towards and whatever makes

**113:47** most sense to help achieve that is

**113:49** fairly D so you or any of the other team

**113:52** members own any royalties in the

**113:54** projects personally Sean Ryan ownes the

**113:57** royalties yeah okay how do you man and

**114:00** he owns shares of the company I I

**114:02** suppose as well correct

**114:05** okay fourth larg shareholder I think is

**114:07** he ear your board yes okay how do you

**114:11** manage that uh relationship there

**114:13** between between his his incentive for

**114:17** making the Royalty work versus his

**114:18** incentive for making the stock price go

**114:20** up because these two things are not

**114:21** always the same thing

**114:23** uh he's always been it's never been a

**114:26** point of contention he's always been

**114:28** aligned with us and doing what it is

**114:29** that makes the stock price go up and

**114:31** it's and it's it's an interesting

**114:34** um uh conversation every year as we're

**114:37** looking to allocate our budget you know

**114:40** I know there's our meat and potatoes I

**114:42** know that the more we drill the more

**114:44** work we do on the Golden Saddle that's

**114:46** continue to grow now as a junior Mining

**114:48** Company what's going to get more excited

**114:50** the market more excited uh how do you

**114:52** get the best bank for your buck for a

**114:54** dollar is it adding a few hundred,

**114:55** ounces a year or is it going to make a

**114:57** brand new discovery right so we've

**114:59** always tilted towards working in the

**115:02** best interest of gamechanging type

**115:05** exploration but in the meantime you know

**115:07** listen we're still prudent we know

**115:08** there's value there so we continue to

**115:10** you know add the value in that

**115:11** perspective but it's mostly been geared

**115:13** towards real sort of gamechanging

**115:14** opportunities because back to point this

**115:16** is supposed this is set up to be a

**115:18** project generator now we haven't

**115:19** generated a project yet just because you

**115:21** know we' had this unique opportunity

**115:24** with with the gold saddle um but what

**115:26** ideally we like to do is once we have a

**115:28** project once we show the scale look to

**115:32** transact on that pay the shareholders

**115:35** and use some of the additional Capital

**115:36** to continue the expiration right we

**115:38** really think there's you know Decades of

**115:39** work that can be done here um but the

**115:42** more money we can use from those types

**115:43** of transactions versus financings that's

**115:46** obviously going to be less dilutive

**115:48** reserve the capital table which again is

**115:51** in our interest is shareholders to help

**115:53** the share prices

**115:55** increase well that about concludes my

**115:57** smell test as I call it before actually

**115:59** getting into the actual barbecuing uh

**116:02** let's talk about what you're doing right

**116:04** now though and where you really want to

**116:05** take the company from here because you

**116:07** mentioned that it was designed to be a

**116:10** prospect generator from the beginning

**116:11** but again you have many many targets

**116:13** right now and an advanced deposit that

**116:15** you believe can grow a depth along

**116:17** strike a Discovery at Betty that needs

**116:19** defining a potential new discovery a QV

**116:21** that needs drilling all of which not

**116:24** inexpensive so what do you do do you

**116:27** spin off some of them are you actively

**116:29** looking for options Partners how do you

**116:31** roll out this strategy of a project or a

**116:33** prospect

**116:35** generator so that's a a great question

**116:37** and that's something that's you know top

**116:39** of mind and it's been particularly top

**116:41** of mind uh recently and you know and and

**116:45** so so there's I would say two or three

**116:48** different uh perspectives that are being

**116:50** uh entertained currently

**116:52** and and they have been this is nothing

**116:54** new uh but the market is I think more

**116:56** constructive today than it has been in

**116:57** the last three years for these types of

**116:59** opportunities uh especially with uh you

**117:01** know some of these other mining

**117:02** companies now really performing well

**117:05** stock pric is appreciated cash positions

**117:07** are better they seem to be more active

**117:09** in these types I don't know if you saw

**117:10** the article in the Global Mail two days

**117:12** ago but it talked about exactly that um

**117:15** so we always have two great mining

**117:16** companies as partners right they have a

**117:18** seat at the table they're looking at

**117:19** things there's a lot of interest they

**117:20** like what they're doing they're and

**117:22** guiding us towards how we can increase

**117:24** the value of those opportunities their

**117:26** interest would be more so on the more

**117:28** advanced type projects um but there's a

**117:31** lot of interest in those projects right

**117:32** you know uh for a mid-tier company with

**117:35** one asset maybe one asset not in the

**117:37** best place in the world to have

**117:38** something of this uh scale in a great

**117:41** place is of Interest so we you know

**117:43** there's there's there are a number of

**117:44** conversations that are um being

**117:47** entertained right now and those continue

**117:49** to grow and it was interesting uh you

**117:52** know I think you were at Beaver Creek as

**117:53** well uh you saw the moood now it's a bit

**117:56** of an interesting situation these guys

**117:58** have great market caps the Juniors don't

**117:59** they're sort of like licking their chops

**118:02** here for opportunities right and they'd

**118:03** almost be remiss not to start um

**118:07** gobbling these things up so you see a

**118:09** lot more activity from that regard I

**118:12** think the corporate development teams

**118:13** and these companies tell me that they're

**118:14** you know the busy they have and we we

**118:16** certainly see it right people with

**118:17** interest C all this kind of stuff so

**118:19** there's that now there's other the the

**118:22** earlier stage opportunities there's new

**118:23** discovery type stuff does somebody come

**118:25** and buy one of those maybe is there

**118:28** other interested parties that might have

**118:29** a different type of structure that might

**118:30** be of interest maybe and what's been

**118:33** really um unique for us in the last year

**118:37** or so which listen we have it's a bit of

**118:40** a double-edged sword when you have a lot

**118:41** of opportunity the challenge is how do

**118:44** you allocate your budget especially in

**118:45** the last few recent years where you know

**118:47** capital's not been overly abundant in

**118:49** the industry as you know so you want to

**118:50** take what you do and try to get the most

**118:52** value out of it uh we also and not

**118:55** surprisingly you know have in addition

**118:58** to our gold which is the focus for sure

**119:01** some very interesting critical mineral

**119:03** opportunities right you mentioned uh

**119:05** Casino we continuous to casino and our

**119:07** Betty and a couple other properties or

**119:08** pedler or Haze that's the largest

**119:10** undeveloped critical mineral deposit in

**119:13** the planet or at least in Canada for

**119:15** sure copper the gold we have two other

**119:18** properties right beside with almost an

**119:19** exact same similar signature with the

**119:21** mum great indicator that's 15 kilm away

**119:25** so now there's interest and discussions

**119:27** on what do we do at do so you know as a

**119:30** company is it practical Is it feasible

**119:32** to work on all them maybe but is it make

**119:35** more sense to have sort of different

**119:37** groups uh you know helping along the way

**119:40** that could be interesting too so I

**119:42** didn't really answer your question

**119:44** because I don't have an exact answer to

**119:45** the question today but these are

**119:47** certainly things that are very topical

**119:50** and actively being evaluated currently

**119:53** with you know real perspective

**119:55** opportunities what's your timeline to

**119:58** have a a more direct strategy for how

**120:01** you're going to realize this value well

**120:03** we have a strategy it's just now you

**120:05** know talking to the different counter

**120:08** parties right so this the timeline is

**120:10** today like these are you know

**120:12** daily matters that are being you know

**120:14** engaged in right it's not like okay

**120:16** here's our strategy let's go in six

**120:17** months and start to reach out to people

**120:19** or um you know you know maybe engage a

**120:22** banker to run a process it's it's all

**120:25** it's it's it is fluid but it is like

**120:28** happening like now and it's been

**120:29** happening for the last little while like

**120:30** there's been more activity in the last

**120:32** three months than in the last three

**120:33** years I think across well for us for

**120:35** sure but you know a lot of these

**120:36** different juniors are starting to see

**120:38** that which I think is uh you know really

**120:41** playing into a much more constructive

**120:44** environment but so essentially spin-offs

**120:47** are still on the table potential options

**120:51** deals are still on the table selling

**120:53** assets separately all of that is still

**120:55** on the table absolutely okay how much

**120:58** does the fact that you have two majors

**121:00** involved at the same time kind of

**121:02** influence that decision though do do

**121:04** they really have any decision sway here

**121:06** outside of their ownership voting

**121:09** structure uh so technically they have

**121:14** their they have their shareholder rights

**121:16** they have a right to nominate a director

**121:19** uh which they haven't yet and um and I

**121:23** think part of that is because we have

**121:24** very close working relationships with

**121:26** them you know we they're uh we really

**121:28** respect their opinion they're great

**121:30** Partners to have obviously some of the

**121:32** best miners in the world and we've been

**121:36** uh just so fortunate to have their

**121:38** guidance technically corporately uh

**121:41** along the way to work with um I would

**121:44** say so so by and large it's been a great

**121:47** positive for the

**121:49** company um you know maybe if you look

**121:52** some of the I would

**121:54** say not challenge but you know maybe

**121:56** some of the other side of that equation

**121:59** where it might have affected the company

**122:01** you know sometimes we'll have

**122:02** conversations with different parties and

**122:03** they'll say oh wow we love this I can't

**122:05** believe it you're so you know what a

**122:06** great asset you have we'd love to you

**122:07** know take a look at it but like you know

**122:09** obviously there's no chance for us to do

**122:10** anything because you already have your

**122:12** dance

**122:13** Partners well you know listen our

**122:16** partners I think are in favor of

**122:18** whatever's best for you know the company

**122:21** is shareholders because at the end of

**122:22** the day they're big shareholders so I I

**122:24** would say nothing is off the table right

**122:26** you know we've seen especially more

**122:27** recently A lot of these companies

**122:28** partner with each other right depending

**122:30** on what their current strategy is on

**122:33** what their current uh resources are and

**122:36** uh you know that's my sense of the

**122:38** relationship and you know we'll see you

**122:40** know if as and when these things start

**122:42** to happen how that plays out but you

**122:44** know I think it by and large it's a

**122:47** positive uh although maybe it could have

**122:49** been perceived otherwise by their people

**122:51** so you know want to make sure everyone

**122:53** is clear on the you know the reality of

**122:56** the situation yeah what what is the

**122:59** relationship between them two though in

**123:02** relation to you if that makes sense

**123:04** because in my experience large gold

**123:06** companies there a lot of rivalry going

**123:09** on especially when they operate kind of

**123:10** the same setting so is there and what I

**123:13** really want to get out of this is white

**123:15** go specifically like is one of them

**123:17** pulling you one side and the other one

**123:18** is pulling you the other side or is it

**123:20** how are they dealing with each other not

**123:21** at all yeah you're right it it is unique

**123:24** especially for to more unique to be

**123:26** involved in a company you know of a

**123:28** junior Explorer but when the deal got

**123:31** done for kin Ros to come in who got came

**123:34** in second you know we clearly wanted

**123:37** igno um to be well aware and and to

**123:41** really get their blessing they were our

**123:42** first partner and you know we were very

**123:44** respectful of our partners because these

**123:46** are long-term relationships right um and

**123:50** in fact which was amazing to me there

**123:53** was a meeting between their respective

**123:55** CEOs which were Shawn Boyd and Paul at

**123:57** the time and Paul rollinson and they

**123:59** literally sat down to talk about it to

**124:02** get to ensure that they were aligned and

**124:04** saw eye to eye and I think you know Sean

**124:07** he's just such a you know he did such a

**124:09** great job building in Nico he loves

**124:11** Canada and he's really uh infused to

**124:15** Contin Advance Mining and expiration in

**124:18** Canada and you know Paul shares a lot of

**124:20** those same views

**124:22** they were it wasn't didn't take long for

**124:24** them to sort of come to realize that you

**124:26** know they would be great Partners uh or

**124:29** co- shareholders in this Venture which

**124:31** really they look at white gold as their

**124:33** expiration arm in the Yukon this

**124:35** prolific area there's so much

**124:37** opportunity you know for them their size

**124:39** they they're not really built to explore

**124:41** it but they love it they believe it they

**124:43** believe there's you know so much value

**124:44** there so they're going to kind of let us

**124:46** go and and do our work and you know

**124:48** they're happy to back the guy who's been

**124:50** more successful than anyone the planet

**124:52** and making discoveries in this part of

**124:54** Canada would they also be happy to back

**124:57** you

**124:58** more how should I call it more

**125:01** specifically as in what they would the

**125:03** idea be to get them to sign a JV if you

**125:07** I don't know Zone in on on that source

**125:09** that you're looking

**125:10** for you

**125:12** know we wanted to you know get the

**125:14** critical mass of you know they're more

**125:16** interested in the bigger stuff right so

**125:18** I think now that the you know the the

**125:20** the Golden Saddle has gotten ccal master

**125:22** and they've got a lot bigger themselves

**125:23** in the meantime they would 100% be

**125:25** interested in or potentially supportive

**125:27** of that how that exactly looks like I

**125:29** said these are you know current

**125:31** conversations but uh for sure like

**125:33** that's that's what they're in for right

**125:36** what are they looking for though in that

**125:38** case like what's a maybe a threshold

**125:39** they have to cross and and maybe this is

**125:41** from your investment banking experience

**125:44** as well what what what would Majors

**125:45** typically look for in this case before

**125:47** they get involved on JV level they

**125:50** haven't given us a number specifically

**125:52** um I think it's grown a little you know

**125:55** just listen both I talked to a lot of

**125:57** Majors right through white gold other

**125:59** Ventures we're involved with and the

**126:01** bigger they are sort of they the more

**126:04** size they need to sort of really get

**126:05** them interested but what's also a fact

**126:08** you have to understand is they look at

**126:09** platforms so if they say you know we

**126:11** want 400,000 ounces of production a year

**126:15** to be able to you know kind of sink our

**126:17** teeth into something that doesn't

**126:18** necessarily have to be from one single

**126:20** deposit and it does have to be today

**126:22** right as long as they have a view to

**126:24** getting there that's what they'll you

**126:26** know start to make moves based upon so

**126:30** you know and they view Yukon sort of BC

**126:34** Alaska kind of northern BC Alaska all

**126:36** sort of part of that same platform so it

**126:39** might be part of a bigger

**126:41** decision um listen these all these

**126:44** companies have been uh busy kind of

**126:48** making some other you know corporately

**126:49** on on their own fronts um but they you

**126:52** know they they've always said like just

**126:54** keep doing what you're doing we like

**126:55** what you're doing and you know when the

**126:57** next step is there I think they'll be

**127:00** you know very open to engage and willing

**127:02** to support you know what we think it is

**127:04** and we think you know look this project

**127:06** we haven't announced the paa yet uh

**127:08** we've done our own internal studies you

**127:10** know we did one in 2020 it was

**127:11** phenomenally robust and uh you know

**127:14** moving that forward today the the

**127:16** deposits gotten bigger we were able to

**127:18** increase the mining throughput rates and

**127:21** it's it's gotten even more robust so

**127:23** we're looking to potentially uh upgrade

**127:25** that to a you know 4311 standard so you

**127:28** can release to the market I think people

**127:29** will be pretty Blown Away by the types

**127:31** of uh you know economics that this type

**127:34** of a project can produce because as you

**127:36** mentioned it comes right to surface it's

**127:38** mainly indicated the core of the deposit

**127:40** million ounces is both three grand right

**127:41** like that's a money maker and you know

**127:43** it depend and it's interesting how the

**127:44** different mining companies from

**127:45** different parts of the world look at the

**127:47** Canadian the North American guys they

**127:49** just want to say you know keep getting

**127:49** it build bigger bigger bigger where

**127:51** sometimes Australian guys they're like

**127:53** no no wow you have a million ounce of

**127:54** three grand let's start mining that and

**127:56** then grow it as we go um so it's it's

**128:00** it's an interesting uh Dynamic but uh

**128:03** listen as shareholders we want to start

**128:05** I think we're at the time in this cycle

**128:07** now where we're seeing the m&a start to

**128:10** pick up we're going to see it to

**128:11** continue and we really kind of want to

**128:13** make sure we got our ADV Dan Partners uh

**128:15** you know fully aligned here to optimize

**128:17** the opportunity for the next I don't

**128:19** know what you know years ahead as you

**128:22** know I think you everyone here probably

**128:24** believes that we're entering a major

**128:26** commodity cycle particularly with the

**128:27** precious metals I don't know about

**128:30** believe I do know about hoping uh that's

**128:32** the only thing we have I suppose in the

**128:33** end when do you want to have that paa

**128:35** out though so that hasn't been decided

**128:37** formally uh it's something that's on the

**128:39** docket here to discuss for uh you know I

**128:42** think next year potentially okay um H1

**128:47** H2 I you know once we announce our plans

**128:49** which is usually sometimes in q1 then

**128:52** then you I'll have better visibility on

**128:54** that right okay I do want to talk about

**128:56** some of the recent exploration that

**128:59** you've been doing this year you've now

**129:00** started focusing on the QV Target it

**129:03** seems what about Betty though is it some

**129:05** something still happening there I know

**129:07** yeah absolutely you know you know I wish

**129:11** as a company I had unlimited uh capital

**129:14** and time because there's so much work to

**129:16** be done here right um now you know we

**129:19** used to sort of have larger programs up

**129:21** until Co we had a shrink them at that

**129:22** point in time just to manage Camp sizes

**129:25** and the last couple of years with the

**129:26** market being it was you know we wanted

**129:28** to make sure we had enough to stay

**129:29** active advance and grow the value of

**129:30** these our projects but again we're

**129:32** sensitive to dilution just because you

**129:34** know we're shareholders first so we're

**129:36** sort of picking and choosing uh between

**129:39** you know it doesn't necessar if

**129:40** something doesn't get looked at right

**129:41** away doesn't mean uh we don't like it

**129:43** it's just you know we're prioritized if

**129:44** we have a discovery okay that's good

**129:46** that's exciting but we think we have

**129:47** another Discovery here sometimes you

**129:48** know you maybe do a little bit of work

**129:50** here but you want to go really like

**129:52** we're always looking for company really

**129:54** changing type of events so the Betty

**129:57** amazing right it's a brand new discovery

**129:59** very high grades from surface first of

**130:01** all the Betty has six different targets

**130:03** they're all a little bit different it's

**130:04** the Betty 4 that we had uh the real

**130:07** success with the last few years hitting

**130:10** you know 50 MERS or three and a half

**130:12** grams from surface on several holes

**130:14** grades up as high as you know nine grams

**130:16** over 18 meters and what's also extremely

**130:20** exciting about that project is it's

**130:22** right contiguous to the coffee project

**130:24** it's on the same fault system the coffee

**130:26** project and you know as an investor

**130:28** you're always looking for Catalyst right

**130:30** what's next I think you know you saw

**130:31** Beaver Creek everyone nobody doubts that

**130:33** the juniors are undervalued especially

**130:36** relative to commy prices everything else

**130:38** but what's going to be that Catalyst to

**130:40** kind of get the sector going which is

**130:41** the most important for everything here

**130:43** as an investor it's flows of funds once

**130:45** the funds you know if and when they do

**130:46** come into the sector all these boats are

**130:48** going to rise with a tide uh

**130:51** theoretically the ones with the best

**130:52** assets are going to go the first and the

**130:54** farthest uh which I think white gold is

**130:56** certainly one of those um but in terms

**130:59** of specific Catalyst for us

**131:03** is that coffee project unfortunately

**131:06** when gold cor was acquired by numont so

**131:08** goor bought that for $550 million that's

**131:12** at about 2.1 million ounces now looking

**131:14** at just the oxides we're at about 2.1

**131:16** million ounces now we're not oxides

**131:18** would be a mill our grade is 1.9 there

**131:21** about

**131:23** 1.2 and you know look at our whole

**131:25** market cap is only $40 million right so

**131:27** you know listen the market has changed

**131:28** gold Corp was going to race to put that

**131:30** into production by 2020 what's would

**131:33** have been phenomenal about that is

**131:34** number one once you have like when's a

**131:36** camp a camp we know there's been 20

**131:37** million ounces of plaster gold we know

**131:40** there's been another you know 5 million

**131:41** ounces discovered by Sha Ryan in our

**131:43** district half coffee half what we have

**131:46** casinos there were 20 million ounces

**131:48** that's you know 40 50 million ounces but

**131:50** there's not one in production so is it a

**131:52** camp yet no once you have a a facility

**131:55** now that changes the economics or

**131:56** everything else but what's also

**131:59** important about that is part of building

**132:02** that mine there's a network of plaster

**132:05** roads in our area the Yukon that goes

**132:07** from Dawson down to the coffee the

**132:09** government

**132:11** has has set aside or provided Capital

**132:15** which is funded to upgrade those roads

**132:17** and pave them to Hall grade roads in our

**132:20** area and actually two of the Yukon but

**132:22** that's all contingent on the m going

**132:24** into production so had the M been built

**132:27** the road been built and now the rest of

**132:29** our properties are all Road accessible

**132:31** which is great makes everything a lot

**132:32** cheaper and makes rates economics when

**132:35** you're in the middle of nowhere not

**132:37** there we are but like if you in general

**132:38** you got to find 2 million oun to make it

**132:40** work when you're in a camp like Timmons

**132:42** like Quebec once you have a couple

**132:44** facilities running you find two 3

**132:45** 400,000 ounces boom that's a that's a

**132:48** satellite pit for your meal so it it

**132:50** really brings a lot of more opportunity

**132:53** anyway fast forward to today that got

**132:54** delayed people have no idea what new

**132:57** Mon's done right they're a big company

**132:59** people and the UK they think it's gone

**133:00** quiet because really there's only three

**133:02** companies there that own everything it's

**133:03** numont it's us fond gold is there um so

**133:07** not a lot of noise numont has done a

**133:09** tremendous amount of drilling and

**133:11** they've more importantly Advanced the

**133:13** project through the perming stages they

**133:15** basically put a bow on it now and now

**133:17** it's up for sale so as that gets

**133:19** acquired here which I'm I understand

**133:21** should be by the DAT of

**133:24** q1 whoever buys it I would assume is

**133:27** going to look to move it forward to

**133:28** production part of the production is the

**133:31** road and now we're back to where we

**133:33** thought we'd be a few years ago with a

**133:35** new party in town waving the flag doing

**133:38** a lot of good work bringing attention to

**133:41** our area bringing a road in which you

**133:43** know we benefit more than everyone else

**133:45** because we really own the district and

**133:47** it's you know we have a huge land

**133:48** package but that land package is

**133:50** something that Sean's you know compiled

**133:52** for 15 years now so it's the best of the

**133:56** best you know we really have 80% of the

**133:58** best Targets in the

**134:00** Ukon exciting to look for that as a

**134:02** near-term catalyst uh in addition to the

**134:05** work we've done which you've asked and

**134:08** sorry I got off track there but where

**134:10** have we been doing the Betty extremely

**134:12** interesting also down in that area like

**134:14** that I believe is total elephant country

**134:16** we have these two other properties the

**134:18** pether and the haze those are actually

**134:21** uh copper poery malum type targets they

**134:25** look quite similar to the casino so

**134:28** these pories happening clusters you have

**134:30** one of the largest pories in Canada for

**134:33** sure maybe the world you know a

**134:35** literally a stone sow away very little

**134:38** work's been done on them the geophysics

**134:41** the GE geological work we've done in the

**134:42** last couple years have made them more

**134:45** more perspective and they really have

**134:48** not seen a drill hole to test that so

**134:50** that's not work that gotten done this

**134:52** year something more interesting you know

**134:53** I'll call that the critical minerals

**134:54** bucket uh that's something you can look

**134:56** forward to going forward but the Betty

**134:59** we love because of where it is um

**135:02** because of what we've seen with the

**135:03** drilling and then these other Targets on

**135:06** the QV so what we've been doing there

**135:08** and this is actually your question like

**135:10** how do the partners help support this

**135:12** iso's idea so as a junior you're going

**135:14** to get the best bank for your buck by

**135:17** making new discoveries versus Bine so

**135:19** say you have a project there it's

**135:21** critical mass but instead of you know if

**135:23** you're going to drill whatever number of

**135:24** meters you have in your budget to drill

**135:25** just delineating it go look for new

**135:28** discoveries in a radius a small radius

**135:31** to that four flag shift project that

**135:33** will be incorporated in that project

**135:35** because now anything you find there will

**135:39** sort of be a creative to your overall

**135:40** project and statistically the best place

**135:43** to discover more gold is near existent

**135:46** deposits so we've taken that approach

**135:48** it's worked we made the the

**135:51** we made two new discoveries one is

**135:53** there's a a mineralized trend that's two

**135:55** kilometers to the west of our Flagship

**135:56** deposit hardly no work got done on that

**135:58** it's it's 6 kilometers long we drilled

**136:01** one target there uh two and three years

**136:05** ago and within with a small amount of

**136:07** drilling we found hundreds of thousand

**136:09** ounces of gold so that got added into

**136:11** our our flash deposit and then we

**136:13** followed that Trend further north onto

**136:15** our QV property and we found this

**136:18** massive what's now 2 km long long Target

**136:22** we have a deposit up there a couple

**136:23** hundred thousand ounces also on Trend so

**136:25** we're starting to see this like pearls

**136:26** on a string type thing and we're very

**136:29** interested in that Target as well so

**136:31** we're doing some work on that

**136:33** also how much is is all that work going

**136:36** to cost you and um how much money do you

**136:39** have left I mean at the end of June I I

**136:41** mentioned you had almost $3 million in

**136:43** cash or cash our Cadence is we typically

**136:46** raise you know flow through once a year

**136:48** that so that you know like I said we

**136:49** want all our money going into the ground

**136:51** so when as a shareholder investor you

**136:52** see that you know that that money is get

**136:54** invested and we typically raise with the

**136:56** flow through you got to basically spend

**136:58** it all within one year um and then

**137:01** that's been our sort of cadence to do it

**137:03** once a year and you know presumably you

**137:06** know that that'll continue we always

**137:08** make sure we have a buffer of Hard Cash

**137:09** to last us for quite a long time just in

**137:12** case the Market's not you know receptive

**137:14** to that type of of a financing we we've

**137:16** been fortunate to have um basically the

**137:19** same groups of investors supporting

**137:21** every year um so nothing's been sort of

**137:24** decided at this point in time but you

**137:26** know presumably that would continue to

**137:27** be the pattern point forward I thought

**137:30** you had two years to two calendar years

**137:32** to spend the flow through so but if you

**137:33** raise it in December then essentially it

**137:35** is only one year yeah it's called The

**137:37** Look Back rule that's right yeah so okay

**137:40** so how how much money so you're gonna

**137:43** have enough money to finish this drill

**137:44** program though and have some new maret

**137:47** drill program you know we have always a

**137:49** couple million bucks on hand

**137:51** and uh just you know as a buffer just in

**137:54** case you know it's a time you know so

**137:57** we're not ever up against the wall terms

**137:59** of time and the the flow through raises

**138:01** and you're running about 150 let's round

**138:04** it up to 150 Grand a month in GNA so

**138:08** that's almost two 1.8 million bucks a

**138:10** year so you're gonna have to raise two

**138:12** million hard cash too it's a little bit

**138:15** less than that the way it works out I

**138:16** know that's maybe with the number

**138:17** showing I don't know if like top of my

**138:19** head like what's in there uh exactly and

**138:22** then like I said sometimes you're

**138:23** looking at like part of the Year where

**138:25** you know there's more activity in GNA

**138:27** than there is sort of the other half of

**138:29** the year when we're uh in the field

**138:31** season but yeah somewhere between you

**138:33** know

**138:34** 100 a little bit over 100,000 a year

**138:37** probably yeah right um what about the a

**138:41** lot of that's obviously

**138:42** discretionary anything else that might

**138:44** be um stopping you or slowing you down

**138:47** permits First Nations I know you're in

**138:48** the Yukon something I want to touch upon

**138:50** is well yeah it's a great that's a great

**138:52** thing to to touch upon and it's

**138:53** extremely important to us it has been

**138:55** since day one a lot of places the Yukon

**138:58** in particular it's a district of it's

**139:00** it's a it's a territory of districts so

**139:02** depending where you are you're going to

**139:03** have unique uh First Nation groups that

**139:06** you're going to deal with yukon's done a

**139:08** really great job in settling agreements

**139:11** with the majority of their first nation

**139:13** so they're they're they're fully settled

**139:15** you sort of know what you're getting

**139:16** into in each of the different areas in

**139:18** our district we're are um primarily

**139:22** dealing with the Tron witchin uh amongst

**139:25** some others uh

**139:27** and we have made it very important to

**139:30** develop a good relationship with them

**139:32** you know we we meet regularly we want to

**139:34** ensure that they're aware of what we're

**139:35** doing we're very respectful of their

**139:38** traditional territories and uh you know

**139:41** they have been involved in mining in

**139:44** certain capacities for a long time

**139:46** because this plaster mining that's been

**139:48** going on for over 100 years is in their

**139:49** traditional territory

**139:51** uh so you know we find them to be

**139:53** supportive obviously they're very

**139:55** Mindful and want things to be done

**139:56** properly which absolutely is uh you know

**139:59** the right thing and we'll always do that

**140:01** so it's it's for us as as whiteold it's

**140:05** uh been a positive relationship for sure

**140:08** and we believe it's very supportive uh

**140:10** the government is certainly extremely

**140:12** supportive of mining expiration they

**140:14** know that that's you know their number

**140:16** one economic driver in the territory

**140:18** yeah yeah at the same time though after

**140:21** what happened with Victoria gold and

**140:22** their leech pad failure open pit mining

**140:25** is frowned upon right now do you think

**140:28** that's going to remain the case could it

**140:30** could it be a challenge for you and the

**140:31** wi I would say open pit mining is

**140:33** frowned upon that was a heap Leach right

**140:36** um so maybe Heap Leach is going to come

**140:38** under more scrutiny white Gold's

**140:40** projects are not Heap Leach um I think

**140:46** as happens with these types of issues it

**140:48** brings more scrutiny which listen things

**140:51** need to be done correctly

**140:54** um you know let's see what the

**140:57** investigations find uh you know what

**140:59** caused the issue if it was just an

**141:01** isolated event something that should

**141:02** have could have been avoided uh but you

**141:06** know I think historically these types of

**141:09** incidents is you know as thankfully

**141:10** nobody got hurt or died um I you know

**141:16** they're quite isolated and they get you

**141:18** know addressed relatively quickly and

**141:20** depending on the government it'll sort

**141:22** of dictate how fast things get back up

**141:24** and running and if you want to sort of

**141:26** think of you know I don't want to say

**141:29** positive but something that you know if

**141:32** you could take as a positive come this

**141:33** really made the government be more vocal

**141:37** about how supportive they are of Mining

**141:40** and in expiration and needed to happen

**141:43** and they're got themselves so involved

**141:46** in this process because they want to

**141:47** facilitate that mind

**141:49** restarting um

**141:51** so I I you know listen we'll see will

**141:53** time will tell for us it has not really

**141:56** had an impact on our operations uh Al

**141:59** particularly you know I think we're

**142:00** fortunate that we're not Heap Leach but

**142:02** um you know we've had our discussions

**142:05** with everyone our first Nations

**142:06** governments or you know pral government

**142:08** or territorial governments and

**142:10** everything is sort of you know

**142:12** continuing to move forward yeah well I

**142:14** know we are up on our time here maybe

**142:17** next time we we chat we should invite

**142:19** Sean with into a little bit of a a geod

**142:22** deep dive see what you've been coming up

**142:23** with because it is interesting Betty's

**142:25** got a few thesis uh Theses that you're

**142:28** working with that that it could be

**142:29** potential different mineralization style

**142:33** so that'll be interesting to get into as

**142:35** well and maybe next time we can have

**142:36** Shawn on yeah I think you should

**142:37** definitely have Shawn on he's Mr Yukon

**142:40** he's the guy that went there with the

**142:41** FIS he's the guy who's uh now you know

**142:43** proven his thesis to be correct uh we

**142:46** scratched the surface he saw with that

**142:48** to the success he sees what other

**142:49** indicators we have and he really feels

**142:51** like we've cracked the Cod right so

**142:53** we've made millions of ounces of gold

**142:54** discoveries he thinks there's millions

**142:56** of ounces of more discoveries you know

**142:57** listen we we there's stuff on Surface

**143:00** we've just been doing surface

**143:01** exploration imagine you go to timens or

**143:03** other these plac in Quebec you're now

**143:04** drilling th kilometers deep we're

**143:06** literally exploring with a tulip auger

**143:08** to start we're finding the gold that's

**143:11** the lowest hanging fruit we still think

**143:12** there's a lot of opportunity there right

**143:14** that's you have to understand so the the

**143:16** way I think I view white gold it's

**143:18** almost like buying a basket of juniors

**143:20** typically this will be five or six

**143:21** different companies on the size of a

**143:22** land package but now you're paying for

**143:24** fight management team marketing all this

**143:26** stuff you have one group it's being

**143:28** Guided by the person that's had the most

**143:30** success in the area most importantly

**143:33** we've had you know we have that core

**143:35** asset the hardest see in this business

**143:37** is is technical success to go make a

**143:39** discovery grow to 2 million ounces

**143:41** that's like a one in 10,000 odds type of

**143:44** a chance so that's already been done

**143:45** that's been done on historic dollars

**143:47** like there's been $150 million in 15

**143:50** years put into that so if you're

**143:51** starting new you got to look at what

**143:53** that's going to take going forward it's

**143:54** probably multiples of that U so you have

**143:57** that in the bank you know I think at a

**144:00** minimum you know we're trading at $20 an

**144:01** ounce probably which is probably a

**144:03** little bit better than most of our peers

**144:04** on an historic basis these things should

**144:06** be trading at probably closer to $100 an

**144:08** ounce so I think there's a huge rating

**144:10** potential there lot of interest like

**144:12** we've been mentioning plus you have all

**144:14** this blue sky Discovery upside with the

**144:16** Betty with the QV with the p and Haze

**144:19** you know a bunch of critical mineral

**144:21** targets so you're getting such you're

**144:23** basically investing in a whole District

**144:25** in white gold that's what we love about

**144:26** that's what we think the opportunity is

**144:28** I think as hopefully funds start to come

**144:30** back to this sector you know you're

**144:32** going to see people really you know show

**144:34** more and more interest for companies

**144:36** like like well I mentioned you know

**144:37** fifth highest grade deposit over 2

**144:39** million ounces in Canada I think that's

**144:41** a tremendous uh asset to be in grade is

**144:43** so important from economic perspective

**144:46** and uh you know we're

**144:48** really as more optimistic probably than

**144:51** we've ever been about the opportunities

**144:52** for additional new discoveries based on

**144:55** what we've seen that led to all our

**144:57** Discovery success uh we've been you know

**144:59** fortunate to attract major shareholders

**145:01** that are the best mining companies in

**145:02** the world I think they share that view

**145:04** the Yukon as a district is phenomenal

**145:06** every you see almost every Mining

**145:08** Company in the world now starting to

**145:09** invest more and more in the Yukon it is

**145:11** one of the few places I think that you

**145:13** can go where you have a great rule of

**145:15** law great geological potential and it's

**145:18** still so underexplored

**145:20** um with more and more government support

**145:22** being sort of announced all the time so

**145:25** really from our perspective checks the

**145:26** boxes and uh you know I think the

**145:29** prospects at this point in time from a

**145:30** risk reward perspective are better than

**145:33** I've ever seen as a you know

**145:36** investor and that's David denaa of white

**145:39** gold Corp and it's wh

**145:48** gold.cap the interest and you know you

**145:51** spend a lot of time digitally in Yukon

**145:52** you got to get to the Yukon it's a

**145:53** wonderful place on the planet I feel

**145:55** invited so I might at one point you're

**145:58** that is an official invitation so this

**145:59** summer I'd love to have you up there
