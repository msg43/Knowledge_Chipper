**06:52** space which we've been following very

**06:53** closely this year the collapse in

**06:55** foreign Capital according to UK based

**06:58** Financial Times calcul ations published

**07:00** today Based on data from Hong Kong's

**07:02** stock connect trading scheme nearly 90%

**07:06** of the foreign money that flowed into

**07:08** China's stock market in 2023 has already

**07:11** left quote spurred by mounting doubts

**07:18** end quote since peaking at 235 billion

**07:22** R&B $ 33 billion in August net foreign

**07:26** investment in China listed shares this

**07:27** year has dropped 87 % to just 30.7

**07:32** billion yen the financial times explains

**07:35** that Traders and analysts say the

**07:37** reversal reflected pessimism over the

**07:39** outlook for China's economy among Global

**07:41** fund managers International investors

**07:44** have been persistent now sellers since

**07:46** August when missed Bond payments by

**07:49** developer Country Garden revealed the

**07:51** severity of a liquidity crisis in the

**07:53** country's property sector quote the

**07:56** confidence issue goes beyond real estate

**07:58** although real estate is key I'm

**08:00** referring to consumer confidence

**08:01** business confidence and investor

**08:03** confidence both from domestic and

**08:06** foreign investors end quote the CSI 300

**08:10** Benchmark has lost 12% so far this year

**08:13** among the world's worst performing major

**08:15** indexes and poised for a third annual

**08:18** decline the CSI 300 is set to close out

**08:21** the year down more than 15% in dollar

**08:24** terms after a promising Q2 Global

**08:27** investor perceptions of Chinese equities

**08:28** deter iated substantially in the second

**08:30** half of this year as pledges of policy

**08:33** support in July were quickly followed by

**08:35** Mis payments at Country Garden and other

**08:38** cash trar developers net foreign sales

**08:41** of China listed shares have reached

**08:43** about 26 billion yen in December and

**08:46** overseas investors are set to record

**08:48** their smallest ever annual purchases of

**08:51** Chinese stocks foreign funds bought just

**08:55** 44 billion yen 6.1 billion of onshore

**08:58** stocks via trading links with Hong Kong

**09:00** on a net basis so far in

**09:03** 2023 us-based Bloomberg reports today

**09:05** that overseas funds are set to flee

**09:07** Chinese stocks for the fifth month in

**09:09** December an unprecedented streak quote

**09:12** it's so counterintuitive the data is

**09:15** getting better and the general

**09:16** environment should be quite positive for

**09:17** Chinese stocks frankly there's no reason

**09:19** for this other than investors basically

**09:20** giving up and saying we don't see the

**09:22** upside end quote more optimistic voices

**09:26** argue that the end of depreciation

**09:28** pressure for the UN may drive some

**09:30** overseas investors back into China

**09:31** though this position was undermined last

**09:34** Friday when Beijing once again spooked

**09:36** markets with more unexpected Crackdown

**09:38** looking rules for the technology and

**09:40** gaming sectors quote the question I get

**09:43** from clients about Chinese equities is

**09:45** which sectors but when they push me I

**09:48** don't know what to tell them because

**09:50** there is no sector in quote okay that is
