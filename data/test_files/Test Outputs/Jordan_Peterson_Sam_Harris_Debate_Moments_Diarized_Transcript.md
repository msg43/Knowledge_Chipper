**00:03:10** quote real atheist okay well I'm I'm I'm

**00:03:10** quote real atheist okay well I'm I'm I'm going  to  read  some  things  that  I  wrote

**00:03:12** going to read some things that I wrote

**00:03:12** going to read some things that I wrote because  it's  so  complicated  that  I'm  not

**00:03:14** because it's so complicated that I'm not

**00:03:14** because it's so complicated that I'm not sure  that  I  can  just  spin  it  off  the  top

**00:03:16** sure that I can just spin it off the top

**00:03:16** sure that I can just spin it off the top of  my  head  and  so  you'll  have  to  excuse

**00:03:20** me okay so

**00:03:20** me okay so here's  here's  some  propositions  and

**00:03:22** here's here's some propositions and

**00:03:22** here's here's some propositions and they're  complicated  and  they  need  to  be

**00:03:24** they're complicated and they need to be

**00:03:24** they're complicated and they need to be unpacked  so  I'm  just  going  to  read  them

**00:03:26** unpacked so I'm just going to read them

**00:03:26** unpacked so I'm just going to read them and  you're  that'll  have  to  do  for  the

**00:03:28** and you're that'll have to do for the

**00:03:28** and you're that'll have to do for the time  being  so  God  Is  How  We

**00:03:31** time being so God Is How We

**00:03:31** time being so God Is How We imaginatively  and  collectively  represent

**00:03:33** imaginatively and collectively represent

**00:03:33** imaginatively and collectively represent the  existence  and  action  of

**00:03:34** the existence and action of

**00:03:34** the existence and action of Consciousness  across  time  as  the  most

**00:03:37** Consciousness across time as the most

**00:03:37** Consciousness across time as the most real  aspects  of  existence  manifest

**00:03:39** real aspects of existence manifest

**00:03:39** real aspects of existence manifest themselves  across  the  longest  of  time

**00:03:41** themselves across the longest of time

**00:03:41** themselves across the longest of time frames  but  are  not  necessarily

**00:03:43** frames but are not necessarily

**00:03:43** frames but are not necessarily apprehensible  as  objects  in  the  here  and

**00:03:45** apprehensible as objects in the here and

**00:03:45** apprehensible as objects in the here and now  so  what  that  means  in  some  sense  is

**00:03:47** now so what that means in some sense is

**00:03:47** now so what that means in some sense is that  you  have  conceptions  of  reality

**00:03:48** that you have conceptions of reality

**00:03:48** that you have conceptions of reality built  into  your  biological  and

**00:03:50** built into your biological and

**00:03:50** built into your biological and metaphysical  structure  that  a

**00:03:52** metaphysical structure that a

**00:03:52** metaphysical structure that a consequence  of  processes  of  evolution

**00:03:54** consequence of processes of evolution

**00:03:54** consequence of processes of evolution that  that  occurred  over  unbelievably

**00:03:56** that that occurred over unbelievably

**00:03:56** that that occurred over unbelievably vast  expanses  of  time  and  that  structure

**00:04:00** vast expanses of time and that structure

**00:04:00** vast expanses of time and that structure your  perception  of  reality  in  ways  that

**00:04:02** your perception of reality in ways that

**00:04:02** your perception of reality in ways that it  wouldn't  be  structured  if  you  only

**00:04:04** it wouldn't be structured if you only

**00:04:04** it wouldn't be structured if you only lived  for  the  amount  of  time  that  you're

**00:04:05** lived for the amount of time that you're

**00:04:05** lived for the amount of time that you're going  to  live  and  that's  also  part  of

**00:04:07** going to live and that's also part of

**00:04:07** going to live and that's also part of the  problem  of  deriving  values  from

**00:04:10** the problem of deriving values from

**00:04:10** the problem of deriving values from Facts  because  you're  evanescent  and  and

**00:04:12** Facts because you're evanescent and and

**00:04:12** Facts because you're evanescent and and you  can't  derive  the  right  values  from

**00:04:14** you can't derive the right values from

**00:04:14** you can't derive the right values from the  facts  that  portray  themselves  to  you

**00:04:17** the facts that portray themselves to you

**00:04:17** the facts that portray themselves to you in  your  lifespan  which  is  why  you  have  a

**00:04:19** in your lifespan which is why you have a

**00:04:19** in your lifespan which is why you have a biological  structure  that  it's  like  3.5

**00:04:21** biological structure that it's like 3.5

**00:04:21** biological structure that it's like 3.5 billion  years  old  so  God  is  that  which

**00:04:24** billion years old so God is that which

**00:04:24** billion years old so God is that which eternally  dies  and  is  reborn  in  the

**00:04:26** eternally dies and is reborn in the

**00:04:26** eternally dies and is reborn in the pursuit  of  higher  being  and  truth  that's

**00:04:28** pursuit of higher being and truth that's

**00:04:28** pursuit of higher being and truth that's a  fundamental  element  of  hero  mythology

**00:04:30** a fundamental element of hero mythology

**00:04:30** a fundamental element of hero mythology God  is  the  highest  value  in  the

**00:04:32** God is the highest value in the

**00:04:32** God is the highest value in the hierarchy  of  values  that's  another  way

**00:04:34** hierarchy of values that's another way

**00:04:34** hierarchy of values that's another way of  looking  at  it  God  is  what  calls  and

**00:04:36** of looking at it God is what calls and

**00:04:36** of looking at it God is what calls and what  responds  in  the  Eternal  Call  to

**00:04:38** what responds in the Eternal Call to

**00:04:38** what responds in the Eternal Call to Adventure  God  is  the  voice  of  conscience

**00:04:43** God is the source of judgment and mercy and  guilt  God  is  the  future  to  which  we

**00:04:47** and guilt God is the future to which we

**00:04:47** and guilt God is the future to which we make  sacrifices  and  something  akin  to

**00:04:49** make sacrifices and something akin to

**00:04:49** make sacrifices and something akin to the  transcendental  repository  of

**00:04:51** the transcendental repository of

**00:04:51** the transcendental repository of reputation  here's  a  cool  one  if  you're

**00:04:53** reputation here's a cool one if you're

**00:04:54** reputation here's a cool one if you're an  evolutionary  biologist  God

**00:04:57** an evolutionary biologist God

**00:04:57** an evolutionary biologist God God  God  is  that  which  selects  among  men

**00:05:01** God God is that which selects among men

**00:05:01** God God is that which selects among men in  the  Eternal  hierarchy  of  men  so  you

**00:05:04** in the Eternal hierarchy of men so you

**00:05:04** in the Eternal hierarchy of men so you know  men  arrange  themselves  into

**00:05:05** know men arrange themselves into

**00:05:05** know men arrange themselves into hierarchies  and  then  men  rise  in  the

**00:05:07** hierarchies and then men rise in the

**00:05:07** hierarchies and then men rise in the hierarchy  and  there's  principles  that

**00:05:10** hierarchy and there's principles that

**00:05:10** hierarchy and there's principles that are  important  that  determine  the

**00:05:12** are important that determine the

**00:05:12** are important that determine the probability  of  their  rise  and  those

**00:05:14** probability of their rise and those

**00:05:14** probability of their rise and those principles  aren't  tyrannical  power

**00:05:16** principles aren't tyrannical power

**00:05:16** principles aren't tyrannical power they're  something  like  the  ability  to

**00:05:18** they're something like the ability to

**00:05:18** they're something like the ability to articulate  truth  and  the  ability  to  be

**00:05:20** articulate truth and the ability to be

**00:05:24** appropriate moral judgments and if you

**00:05:24** appropriate moral judgments and if you can  do  that  in  a  given  situation  then

**00:05:26** can do that in a given situation then

**00:05:26** can do that in a given situation then all  the  other  men  will  vote  you  up  the

**00:05:28** all the other men will vote you up the

**00:05:28** all the other men will vote you up the hierarchy  so  to  speak  and  that  will

**00:05:33** Fitness and the operation of that process  across  long  expanses  of  time

**00:05:35** process across long expanses of time

**00:05:35** process across long expanses of time looks  to  me  like  it's  codified  in

**00:05:37** looks to me like it's codified in

**00:05:37** looks to me like it's codified in something  like  the  notion  of  God  the

**00:05:38** something like the notion of God the

**00:05:38** something like the notion of God the Father  it's  also  the  same  thing  that

**00:05:40** Father it's also the same thing that

**00:05:40** Father it's also the same thing that makes  women  men  attractive  to  women

**00:05:42** makes women men attractive to women

**00:05:42** makes women men attractive to women because  men  women  peel  off  the  top  of

**00:05:45** because men women peel off the top of

**00:05:45** because men women peel off the top of the  male  hierarchy  and  the  question  is

**00:05:47** the male hierarchy and the question is

**00:05:47** the male hierarchy and the question is what  should  be  at  the  top  of  the

**00:05:48** what should be at the top of the

**00:05:48** what should be at the top of the hierarchy  and  the  answer  right  now  is

**00:05:50** hierarchy and the answer right now is

**00:05:50** hierarchy and the answer right now is tyranny  as  part  of  the  patriarchy  but

**00:05:52** tyranny as part of the patriarchy but

**00:05:52** tyranny as part of the patriarchy but the  real  answer  is  something  more  like

**00:05:54** the real answer is something more like

**00:05:54** the real answer is something more like the  ability  to  use  truthful  speech  in

**00:05:57** the ability to use truthful speech in

**00:05:57** the ability to use truthful speech in the  service  of  let's  say  well-being  and

**00:05:59** the service of let's say well-being and

**00:05:59** the service of let's say well-being and so  that's  that's  something  that  operates

**00:06:01** so that's that's something that operates

**00:06:01** so that's that's something that operates across  tremendous  expenses  of  time  and

**00:06:03** across tremendous expenses of time and

**00:06:03** across tremendous expenses of time and it  plays  a  role  in  the  selection  for

**00:06:05** it plays a role in the selection for

**00:06:05** it plays a role in the selection for survival  itself  which  makes  it  a

**00:06:07** survival itself which makes it a

**00:06:07** survival itself which makes it a fundamental  reality  to  Jordan  Nevada  can

**00:06:09** fundamental reality to Jordan Nevada can

**00:06:09** fundamental reality to Jordan Nevada can I  just  cut  in  here  with  one  question  uh

**00:06:11** I just cut in here with one question uh

**00:06:11** I just cut in here with one question uh stop  with  that  for  now  what

**00:06:22** so I I was not hearing in that list of

**00:06:22** so I I was not hearing in that list of attributes  a  God  who

**00:06:25** attributes a God who

**00:06:25** attributes a God who could  care  if  anyone  masturbated

**00:06:28** could care if anyone masturbated

**00:06:28** could care if anyone masturbated I  was  not  hearing  a  God  who  depends  what

**00:06:32** I was not hearing a God who depends what

**00:06:32** I was not hearing a God who depends what else  is  stopping  you  from  doing  Sam

**00:08:19** and own it it's like I was just listen I

**00:08:19** and own it it's like I was just listen I was  as  clear  as  I  possibly  could  be  when

**00:08:22** was as clear as I possibly could be when

**00:08:22** was as clear as I possibly could be when I  delineated  my  answer  to  the  question

**00:08:24** I delineated my answer to the question

**00:08:24** I delineated my answer to the question people  say  well  what  do  you  mean  by  God

**00:08:27** people say well what do you mean by God

**00:08:27** people say well what do you mean by God someone  wants  to  ask  you  if  Jesus  one

**00:08:30** someone wants to ask you if Jesus one

**00:08:30** someone wants to ask you if Jesus one second  answer  but  no  well  forget  it  man

**00:08:35** second answer but no well forget it man

**00:08:35** second answer but no well forget it man I  think  we  can  actually

**00:08:42** I don't want to end on a note of

**00:08:42** I don't want to end on a note of acrimony  but  someone  once  asked  you

**00:08:44** acrimony but someone once asked you

**00:08:44** acrimony but someone once asked you whether  you  thought  Jesus  was  literally

**00:08:46** whether you thought Jesus was literally

**00:08:46** whether you thought Jesus was literally resurrected  and  you  said  it  would  take

**00:08:49** resurrected and you said it would take

**00:08:49** resurrected and you said it would take me  40  hours  to  answer  that  question

**00:08:51** me 40 hours to answer that question

**00:08:51** me 40 hours to answer that question okay  that's  that's  the  kind  of  thing  I'm

**00:08:54** okay that's that's the kind of thing I'm

**00:08:54** okay that's that's the kind of thing I'm responding  to  here  you  don't  need  to  do

**00:08:55** responding to here you don't need to do

**00:08:55** responding to here you don't need to do that  if  you  have  a  clear-cut  answer  to

**00:08:58** that if you have a clear-cut answer to

**00:08:58** that if you have a clear-cut answer to that  question  I  don't  have  a  clear

**00:08:59** that question I don't have a clear

**00:09:00** that question I don't have a clear Credence  and  if  you  don't  and  if  you

**00:09:02** Credence and if you don't and if you

**00:09:02** Credence and if you don't and if you don't  that  that  connects  with  many  other

**00:09:04** don't that that connects with many other

**00:09:04** don't that that connects with many other things  that  we  still  have  to  talk  about

**00:09:06** things that we still have to talk about

**00:09:06** things that we still have to talk about yes  definitely  yeah  I  think  because

**00:09:08** yes definitely yeah I think because

**00:09:08** yes definitely yeah I think because because

**00:09:09** because

**00:09:09** because that  it  isn't  obvious  in  the  biblical

**00:09:12** that it isn't obvious in the biblical

**00:09:12** that it isn't obvious in the biblical account  that  Christ  was  literally

**00:09:14** account that Christ was literally

**00:09:14** account that Christ was literally resurrected  so  it's  not  simple  no  no  but

**00:09:18** resurrected so it's not simple no no but

**00:09:18** resurrected so it's not simple no no but if  the  question  is  do  you  think  let's

**00:09:21** if the question is do you think let's

**00:09:21** if the question is do you think let's put  it  probabilistically  I  mean

**00:09:22** put it probabilistically I mean

**00:09:22** put it probabilistically I mean anything's  possible  I'll  tell  you  that

**00:09:24** anything's possible I'll tell you that

**00:09:24** anything's possible I'll tell you that it's  possible  that  he  was  physically

**00:09:25** it's possible that he was physically

**00:09:25** it's possible that he was physically resurrected  I  mean  it's  it's  not  it's

**00:09:27** resurrected I mean it's it's not it's

**00:09:27** resurrected I mean it's it's not it's even  possible  wait  a  second  with  respect

**00:09:29** even possible wait a second with respect

**00:09:29** even possible wait a second with respect to  quantum  mechanics

**00:09:31** to quantum mechanics

**00:09:31** to quantum mechanics the  point  is  I  said  it  would  take  me  40

**00:09:33** the point is I said it would take me 40

**00:09:33** the point is I said it would take me 40 hours  to  answer  the  question  I  didn't

**00:09:34** hours to answer the question I didn't

**00:09:34** hours to answer the question I didn't say  that  he  was  we'll  go  that  way  how's

**00:09:37** say that he was we'll go that way how's

**00:09:37** say that he was we'll go that way how's this  for  an  answer  almost  certainly  not

**00:09:44** number two

**00:09:44** number two ghosts  after  Jordan  spent  a  good  bit  of

**00:09:47** ghosts after Jordan spent a good bit of

**00:09:47** ghosts after Jordan spent a good bit of time  sharing  his  ideas  of  what  God  is

**00:09:48** time sharing his ideas of what God is

**00:09:48** time sharing his ideas of what God is Sam  used  an  analogy  to  expose  an

**00:09:51** Sam used an analogy to expose an

**00:09:51** Sam used an analogy to expose an apparent  flaw  in  Jordan's  thinking  I'm

**00:09:53** apparent flaw in Jordan's thinking I'm

**00:09:53** apparent flaw in Jordan's thinking I'm wondering  what  percentage  of  religious

**00:09:55** wondering what percentage of religious

**00:09:55** wondering what percentage of religious people  who  who  would  say  oh  yeah  I

**00:09:57** people who who would say oh yeah I

**00:09:57** people who who would say oh yeah I believe  in  God  and  it's  the  most

**00:09:58** believe in God and it's the most

**00:09:58** believe in God and it's the most important  thing  in  my  life  uh  what

**00:10:01** important thing in my life uh what

**00:10:01** important thing in my life uh what percentage  of  those  religious  people  do

**00:10:03** percentage of those religious people do

**00:10:03** percentage of those religious people do you  think  have  in  mind  a  god  of  the  sort

**00:10:04** you think have in mind a god of the sort

**00:10:04** you think have in mind a god of the sort you  just  described  I  don't  know  Sam  it's

**00:10:06** you just described I don't know Sam it's

**00:10:06** you just described I don't know Sam it's a  good  question  because  when  I  go  talk

**00:10:08** a good question because when I go talk

**00:10:08** a good question because when I go talk to  people  when  I  when  I  talk  to  people

**00:10:11** to people when I when I talk to people

**00:10:11** to people when I when I talk to people online  and  use  exactly  this  terminology

**00:10:13** online and use exactly this terminology

**00:10:13** online and use exactly this terminology millions  of  people  listen

**00:10:15** millions of people listen

**00:10:15** millions of people listen so  it's  not  so  obvious  which  what

**00:10:16** so it's not so obvious which what

**00:10:16** so it's not so obvious which what percentage  of  people  see  it  this  way

**00:10:18** percentage of people see it this way

**00:10:18** percentage of people see it this way it's  it  may  be  that  they  have  the

**00:10:20** it's it may be that they have the

**00:10:20** it's it may be that they have the intuitions  but  they  haven't  been

**00:10:21** intuitions but they haven't been

**00:10:21** intuitions but they haven't been articulated  well  I  mean  this  is  this  is

**00:10:23** articulated well I mean this is this is

**00:10:23** articulated well I mean this is this is the  problem  this  is  what  worries  me

**00:10:25** the problem this is what worries me

**00:10:25** the problem this is what worries me about  this  so

**00:10:31** yeah I mean you you you could do the

**00:10:31** yeah I mean you you you could do the same  thing  with

**00:10:33** same thing with

**00:10:33** same thing with the  idea  of  ghosts  right  so  so  people

**00:10:36** the idea of ghosts right so so people

**00:10:36** the idea of ghosts right so so people traditionally  have  believed  in  ghosts

**00:10:38** traditionally have believed in ghosts

**00:10:38** traditionally have believed in ghosts it's  a  it's  an  archetype  you  might  say

**00:10:40** it's a it's an archetype you might say

**00:10:40** it's a it's an archetype you might say the  ghost  survival  of  death  is  certainly

**00:10:42** the ghost survival of death is certainly

**00:10:42** the ghost survival of death is certainly an  archetypes  and  we  know  what  most

**00:10:45** an archetypes and we know what most

**00:10:45** an archetypes and we know what most people  most  of  the  time  mean  when  they

**00:10:47** people most of the time mean when they

**00:10:47** people most of the time mean when they say  they  believe  in  ghosts  and  I  say  I

**00:10:50** say they believe in ghosts and I say I

**00:10:50** say they believe in ghosts and I say I don't  believe  in  ghosts  and  you  say  no

**00:10:52** don't believe in ghosts and you say no

**00:10:52** don't believe in ghosts and you say no no  you  you  do  believe  in  ghosts  ghosts

**00:10:55** no you you do believe in ghosts ghosts

**00:10:55** no you you do believe in ghosts ghosts are  your  relationship  to  the  Unseen

**00:10:58** are your relationship to the Unseen

**00:10:58** are your relationship to the Unseen that's  a  ghost  so  you  have  a  a  new

**00:11:02** that's a ghost so you have a a new

**00:11:02** that's a ghost so you have a a new definition  of  ghost  that  you're  putting

**00:11:03** definition of ghost that you're putting

**00:11:03** definition of ghost that you're putting in  in  the  place  provided  which  I  have  to

**00:11:06** in in the place provided which I have to

**00:11:06** in in the place provided which I have to say  well  of  course  I  have  a  relationship

**00:11:07** say well of course I have a relationship

**00:11:07** say well of course I have a relationship to  the  Unseen  so  I  I  guess  I  do  believe

**00:11:10** to the Unseen so I I guess I do believe

**00:11:10** to the Unseen so I I guess I do believe in  ghosts  you  know  you  win  that  argument

**00:11:17** but that

**00:11:17** but that simply  isn't  what  most  people  mean  by  a

**00:11:20** simply isn't what most people mean by a

**00:11:20** simply isn't what most people mean by a ghost  mostly  but  you  can't  use  that

**00:11:22** ghost mostly but you can't use that

**00:11:22** ghost mostly but you can't use that simplified  argument  about  my  conception

**00:11:25** simplified argument about my conception

**00:11:25** simplified argument about my conception of  ghosts  as  an  analogy  for  the

**00:11:26** of ghosts as an analogy for the

**00:11:26** of ghosts as an analogy for the propositions  that  I  just  put  forward

**00:11:28** propositions that I just put forward

**00:11:28** propositions that I just put forward this  is  what  I  see  you  do  I  mean  maybe

**00:11:29** this is what I see you do I mean maybe

**00:11:29** this is what I see you do I mean maybe you  have  more  to  say  on  the  topic  of  God

**00:11:31** you have more to say on the topic of God

**00:11:31** you have more to say on the topic of God but  this  is  what  I  hear  you  doing  with

**00:11:33** but this is what I hear you doing with

**00:11:33** but this is what I hear you doing with God  you  have  defined

**00:11:35** God you have defined

**00:11:35** God you have defined God  that  most  people  believe  in  and  we

**00:11:37** God that most people believe in and we

**00:11:37** God that most people believe in and we know  this  is  the  god  that  most  people  I

**00:11:39** know this is the god that most people I

**00:11:39** know this is the god that most people I was  asked  what  God  I  believed  in  no  yes

**00:11:41** was asked what God I believed in no yes

**00:12:20** Heaven and Hell

**00:12:20** Heaven and Hell our  top  spot  goes  to  this  moment  where

**00:12:22** our top spot goes to this moment where

**00:12:22** our top spot goes to this moment where Jordan  used  ideas  from  Sam's  book  the

**00:12:25** Jordan used ideas from Sam's book the

**00:12:25** Jordan used ideas from Sam's book the moral  landscape  to  argue  that  if  Sam

**00:12:27** moral landscape to argue that if Sam

**00:12:27** moral landscape to argue that if Sam just  took  his  thinking  a  bit  further  he

**00:12:29** just took his thinking a bit further he

**00:12:29** just took his thinking a bit further he would  arrive  at  a  surprising  conclusion

**00:12:31** would arrive at a surprising conclusion

**00:12:31** would arrive at a surprising conclusion so  I'm  going  to  do  a  quick  re-reading  of

**00:12:33** so I'm going to do a quick re-reading of

**00:12:33** so I'm going to do a quick re-reading of the  moral  landscape

**00:12:35** the moral landscape

**00:12:35** the moral landscape so  because  see  you  talk  about  GE  Moore's

**00:12:39** so because see you talk about GE Moore's

**00:12:39** so because see you talk about GE Moore's argument  of  infinite  regress

**00:12:41** argument of infinite regress

**00:12:42** argument of infinite regress who  claim  that  something's  good  and  you

**00:12:43** who claim that something's good and you

**00:12:43** who claim that something's good and you equate  it  with  something  you  can  also

**00:12:44** equate it with something you can also

**00:12:44** equate it with something you can also ask  infinitely  why  the  thing  you're

**00:12:46** ask infinitely why the thing you're

**00:12:46** ask infinitely why the thing you're equating  it  with  is  good

**00:12:48** equating it with is good

**00:12:48** equating it with is good now  it  seems  to  me  that  the  way  that  you

**00:12:50** now it seems to me that the way that you

**00:12:50** now it seems to me that the way that you step  out  of  that  argument

**00:12:53** step out of that argument

**00:12:53** step out of that argument correct  me  if  I'm  wrong  here  is  you  tell

**00:12:54** correct me if I'm wrong here is you tell

**00:12:54** correct me if I'm wrong here is you tell this  you  tell  us  you  tell  a  story

**00:12:57** this you tell us you tell a story

**00:12:57** this you tell us you tell a story I'm  not  trying  to  be  smart  about  that

**00:12:58** I'm not trying to be smart about that

**00:12:58** I'm not trying to be smart about that you  tell  two  stories  you  tell  a  story

**00:13:01** you tell two stories you tell a story

**00:13:01** you tell two stories you tell a story about  someone  who  has  an  absolutely

**00:13:02** about someone who has an absolutely

**00:13:02** about someone who has an absolutely terrible  life  they're  in  a  in  a  jungle

**00:13:05** terrible life they're in a in a jungle

**00:13:05** terrible life they're in a in a jungle where  nature  is  trying  to  kill  them  all

**00:13:07** where nature is trying to kill them all

**00:13:07** where nature is trying to kill them all the  time  and  while  they're  trying  to  be

**00:13:08** the time and while they're trying to be

**00:13:08** the time and while they're trying to be killed  by  Nature  while  nature  is  trying

**00:13:10** killed by Nature while nature is trying

**00:13:10** killed by Nature while nature is trying to  kill  them  all  the  time  horrible

**00:13:11** to kill them all the time horrible

**00:13:11** to kill them all the time horrible barbaric  thugs  are  making  their  life

**00:13:13** barbaric thugs are making their life

**00:13:13** barbaric thugs are making their life miserable  in  every  possible  way  okay  so

**00:13:16** miserable in every possible way okay so

**00:13:16** miserable in every possible way okay so that's  one

**00:13:17** that's one

**00:13:17** that's one pull  let's  say  and  then  another  Pool  you

**00:13:20** pull let's say and then another Pool you

**00:13:20** pull let's say and then another Pool you identify  and  these  are  hypotheticals  so

**00:13:22** identify and these are hypotheticals so

**00:13:22** identify and these are hypotheticals so I  guess  they're  fictions  that's  one  way

**00:13:24** I guess they're fictions that's one way

**00:13:24** I guess they're fictions that's one way of  thinking  about  it  even  though  they're

**00:13:25** of thinking about it even though they're

**00:13:25** of thinking about it even though they're extracted  from  real  situations  they're

**00:13:28** extracted from real situations they're

**00:13:28** extracted from real situations they're they're  they're  meta  fictions  they're

**00:13:29** they're they're meta fictions they're

**00:13:29** they're they're meta fictions they're meta  truths  that's  another  way  of

**00:13:31** meta truths that's another way of

**00:13:31** meta truths that's another way of thinking  about  it  you  contrast  a  good

**00:13:33** thinking about it you contrast a good

**00:13:33** thinking about it you contrast a good life  and  you  know  that's  a  life  where

**00:13:34** life and you know that's a life where

**00:13:34** life and you know that's a life where the  person  has  enough  to  eat  and  enough

**00:13:37** the person has enough to eat and enough

**00:13:37** the person has enough to eat and enough shelter  and  you  know  they  have  the

**00:13:39** shelter and you know they have the

**00:13:39** shelter and you know they have the things  that  you  would  expect  people  to

**00:13:40** things that you would expect people to

**00:13:40** things that you would expect people to want  you  say  this  is  a  bad  life  and  you

**00:13:42** want you say this is a bad life and you

**00:13:42** want you say this is a bad life and you say  this  is  a  good  life  and  so  and  then

**00:13:45** say this is a good life and so and then

**00:13:45** say this is a good life and so and then you  say  that's  and  and  then  you  make  a

**00:13:47** you say that's and and then you make a

**00:13:47** you say that's and and then you make a side  move  which  I  would  say  is  that

**00:13:48** side move which I would say is that

**00:13:48** side move which I would say is that that's  an  objectively  verifiable  fact  I

**00:13:51** that's an objectively verifiable fact I

**00:13:51** that's an objectively verifiable fact I would  say  I  don't  think  it  is  an

**00:13:53** would say I don't think it is an

**00:13:53** would say I don't think it is an objectively  verifiable  fact  I  think  it's

**00:13:55** objectively verifiable fact I think it's

**00:13:55** objectively verifiable fact I think it's a  fundamental  moral  claim  and  I  think

**00:13:58** a fundamental moral claim and I think

**00:13:58** a fundamental moral claim and I think that's  where  you  put  your  stake  in  the

**00:13:59** that's where you put your stake in the

**00:14:00** that's where you put your stake in the ground  and  I  would  say  when  I  read  that

**00:14:01** ground and I would say when I read that

**00:14:01** ground and I would say when I read that I  thought

**00:14:02** I thought

**00:14:02** I thought well  if  you  take  your  jungle  story  which

**00:14:06** well if you take your jungle story which

**00:14:06** well if you take your jungle story which you've  extracted  from  a  bunch  of  Horrors

**00:14:08** you've extracted from a bunch of Horrors

**00:14:08** you've extracted from a bunch of Horrors and  and  compiled

**00:14:10** and and compiled

**00:14:10** and and compiled and  you  take  your  positive  story  which

**00:14:12** and you take your positive story which

**00:14:12** and you take your positive story which you've  extracted  from  the  bunch  of

**00:14:13** you've extracted from the bunch of

**00:14:13** you've extracted from the bunch of Horrors  or  a  bunch  of  of  of  of

**00:14:16** Horrors or a bunch of of of of

**00:14:16** Horrors or a bunch of of of of quasi-utopias  let's  say  and  compiled

**00:14:18** quasi-utopias let's say and compiled

**00:14:18** quasi-utopias let's say and compiled you're  two-thirds  of  the  way  to  a

**00:14:20** you're two-thirds of the way to a

**00:14:21** you're two-thirds of the way to a landscape  of  Hell  In  Heaven

**00:14:22** landscape of Hell In Heaven

**00:14:22** landscape of Hell In Heaven right  also  then  why  not  continue  the

**00:14:25** right also then why not continue the
