hey everybody hope you guys are ready for another tech talk Style video I've been thinking about this one for a while now I have a lot of customers asking me about this stuff so I'm going to try and put this one together for you is easy as easily as I can I mean I'm going to try to put this in layman's terms and try to make it easy to understand the subject of course by wiring and by amping what's the difference where do you get the gains where are there no gains you know I have people all the time asking me about our speaker cables can I use these to make a bu wire cable let's get into it first of all a lot of you guys have speakers out there with binding post cup just like this you've got two sets of binding post cups it's very common very popular and for a lot of those commercial speakers out there it checks off one of those little check marks like hey it's better because it's got two sets binding post you can buy wire or buy amp does that make it better in most cases no it does not make it better instead of just the insertion losses of one set of cheesy binding post you got all the insertion losses of two sets of cheesing binding post with steel nuts in terminals on the backs of both of them these things have accumulative effect the more connections like this you have in the signal path the worse it's going to be so yeah I have guys saying well um isn't it better to buy wire and and you you've got your typical like this is 12 gauge zip cord that you'll plug into these things and they'll think well if one is okay then two's got to be better right so you got two of these cables now you got one for the highs and one for the lows so what did it do did it separate the lows from the highs no no no it didn't back at the other end at the amplifier they're both connected to the same amplifier so electrically everything's the same um nothing really changed as far as the load of the amplifier what did change was instead of one antenna on the on the back of your amplifier and hooked up to your speaker picking up RF noise and Emi now you got two of them now you got double the amount of noise going to these things and you got got all this in the signal path you got two of these in the signal path what I've told people before when they say yeah I've got mine set up and I've bi-wired it okay what they've done is they've taken these little connectors off so that they're not connected here they're only connected at the amplifier end so what I usually tell them is okay take that little piece of whatever this is 10 put it back in there and listen to it with them in and with them out with both your cables plugged in tell me if you hear a difference most cases they call me back and they say no I didn't hear really any difference at all technically you could hear some difference in the base response because with these little devices connected your woofer can now draw current through both of the cables instead of through one so you've made a little lower resistance in the only range that needs it and that's in the very bottom end so you it might actually sound better if you're using both of them together and not separating them because those lower ranges need current so I've got guys that say well can I take your B16 cable or your 16 strand cable or your 24 strand cable and separate that into for instance the 24 strand cable six six wires on the Tweeter six wires on the woer and I say yes you can and that's going to be a whole lot better than these chezy wires here where you've got two antennas on there the this type of geometry cancels out a lot of that noise it cancels out the radio frequency interference and electromagnetic interference and I know a lot of you guys out there think that technically that stuff can't matter but in reality it really does and especially amps with negative feedback a lot of that noise gets sent right back through the amplifier and it does affect things so you guys are saying well I can use this cable and it'll be better and yeah it would be better than this cable but what you're doing is you're taking a a cable that in this case is equivalent to eight gauge wire and you're cutting it in half because you're only using six per leg so you're dropping that resistance uh or you're raising that resistance a little bit so you can't really draw as much current through it as if you're using the whole thing because your woer now has six hooked up to it six wires instead of 12 hooked up to it so you've kind of shot yourself in the foot in a way I mean you're you're not getting the benefit of the whole cable it's the low frequency driver that needs the current the Tweeter is nothing it it could use one set of these wires and it would still be fine because it it doesn't need that much current so a lot of you guys didn't say well I'll put eight on the woofer and four on the Tweeter yes you could and that would be better but not as good as using the entire cable for the whole signal trust me it's not a problem for that cable to in addition to carrying the low frequency ranges to carry the high frequency ranges as well so what helps then where where do you get the benefit then if you're going to go to a good quality cable like this knock these things off your speaker take these cheesy binding posts out put one set of tube connectors in its place so you got high Purity copper tube replacing these bonding pose now we're talking now we've got all this out of the signal path and a good cable now you're stepping up the performance a lot especially when you came from two sets of these on four of these to one good cable on a set of tube connectors now we're talking all right but then you guys say well what about by amping I can put with this connections I can put an amp on the woofer and an amp on the Tweeter what do I gain then on a speaker like this one on a little two-way speaker like the little X Bravo I've got sitting up here you gain nothing yeah pretty much nothing um there are ways to buy amp and I'm going to explain them to you and tell you exactly how it makes a tremendous difference to buy amp but splitting up a little two-way speaker or even a three-way speaker is not gaining you anything think of that amplifier that's driving the wer to in in addition to driving that wer to add the Tweeter to it it's nothing it's nothing to add a little Tweeter to what's going on here it's the wer that's going to demand the current like I said Tweeter doesn't add anything to it carrying that signal along with it no problem nothing going on there that whether you split that into one amplifier two amplifiers everything's the same the difference is you go to two amplifiers now you got two sets of R RCA connectors you got two two sets of speaker cables you got two different power cables you've got a lot of additional components there that could bring in more noise to the system it's good going to definitely cost a lot more money especially when you step into good quality cables good quality amps you're doubling the amount of money that you're spending on this stuff and you didn't gain anything trust me nothing now in some cases with a big three-way speaker if the crossover point is fairly low like the cross over Point let's say is 160 to 100 Hertz or less to the big woofer you can start then seeing some gains by putting that large woofer on a different amplifier because that large woofer needs a lot of current and when you remove that from the amplification that's covering the upper ranges you're adding additional Headroom to that amplifier so it's it's a lot easier to drive let me illustrate this I set up one of our just 12-in woofers um over the shop a little bit ago and we videoed me sending that thing I don't know it was about 40 or 50 watts of power and I sent it a 10 HT sine wave and that woler was yes doing this it was moving in fact we had trouble videoing it because of the speed of the woofer versus the shutter speed of the camera got even worse when we went to 20 HZ the wford looked like it was doing this but in reality it was just just moving so we looked at it at 10 Hertz then we looked at it at 20 htz and when we went to 20 HZ the Excursion chopped down to half and then we went to 40 Hertz and again the Excursion chopped down to half again and then we went to 80 Herz by comparison it was hardly even moving let's take a look at it let's look at the footage all right here we go with 10 Hertz 20 Herz 40 Hertz and 80 HZ all right was that cool or what and man at 10 HZ that thing was just playing its butt off man that thing was moving even at 20 HZ it was moving now in those ranges where you're really having to move a cone a long way it requires a lot of current I mean it's really pulling juice from that amplifier as you go higher and higher in frequency the current demand is just nothing by comparison so the way to buy amp and the way to get some real gains from buy amping is not to split your drivers up into different amps it's to remove the low frequency from your main power amp that's driving your main speaker and the way to do that is just do an inline filter like some of these that I I showed earlier uh in another video this is just an RCA in an RCA out there's a bypass here that is unfiltered there's just a Sonic cap platinum in here that is designed to remove the low frequencies from the amplifier that it's plugged into so it's it's just a highpass filter so what you want to do is let's say you got a pair of Min monitors calculate the input impedance of your amplifier and what cap value it's going to take to make it 3db down at 40 or 3db down at 50 and plug that into your amplifier now that woofer that was it wasn't playing that low but it's still seeing that that voltage there it's still seeing that that signal and it's trying to play it it's doing this it doesn't have much output but it's still moving and when you knock that out of it the cone movement gets cut down significantly um everything that that speaker's having to play it's its workload got cut in half and the demand of the current on that amplifier got cut in half now you've doubled the Headroom of your amplifier because it's not seeing a big current demand all that lows has been filtered off go one more go up to 80 instead of filtering from from 40 and down filter from 80 and down now you've cut more than half of it off again you've cut like 75 80% of the workload of that speaker is now gone that woler is no longer having to play those low frequency ranges so it's a lot easier for it to play those shorter ones because remember this is a compromise when you're sending in a 20 H note and a vocal and a whole bunch of things all at once it's trying to do those long throws and at the same time the little short ones all in between to recreate that full sound that you're getting all the way up to where the Tweeter plays and when you knock those long excursions off of it man you've really knocked the cone movement out now it's freed it up to more accurately play all of those shorter wavelengths and do so a lot cleaner now that you've knocked the base out of your main speakers like on this one for instance there's a bypass plug that into your subwoofer let a separate subwoofer play those low frequencies now you are bu aing you have two amps in the system you have an amp on the subwoofer and an amp on your main speakers and you can get a lot of good from doing that I mean you're knocking that workload off of that main system and you're dish that off to a different amp and you're dishing it off to an amp that you may have a lot of control over especially if you're using some of our Servo Subs you can make that whole bottom end do anything you want and you've knocked all of that off of your main speakers we do it all the time we do it even with the big speakers we'll knock that first octave out dish that over to the subwoofers man now we're talking huge benefits but trying to BU amplify a two-way speaker or three-way speaker and separate the Tweeter from the mid to the you're not gaining anything it's not doing it you're not helping yourself you're spending money so do it wisely use good quality Parts use good quality cables there's a whole new level of performance out there for you guys do just doing the basics and doing them right I hope this helped I know I tried to make it as easy to understand as possible I didn't get technical on this I hope hopefully I described everything in a way that makes sense and I hope it helps if you have questions throw them in the comment section if you think you're the technical whiz on this and you want to correct me on all the details and throw a bunch of don't do that we're trying to make this to where everybody can understand it and just simplify everything into layman's terms that was the goal so hopefully that's what happened hopefully you guys got it and hopefully it helps you guys take your systems to another level that's it on by wiring and bu amping and see you guys in the next video
